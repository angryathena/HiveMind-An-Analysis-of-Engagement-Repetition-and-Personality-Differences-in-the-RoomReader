T001,1.69,30.61,28.92,"OK so hi everyone and thanks for coming. Today we're going to play a quiz so I'm going to ask you a question and you need to give me the tree most popular answers. The question was asked to 100 people anyway, so after you get the tree top answers, I'm going to ask you to rank them from most popular to least popular. So for example, if I said name something that people are afraid of, you might say other people, spiders and heights."
T001,31.37,41.04,9.67,"And the ordering would be spiders heights, other people and need to come to that order as a team. So there needs to be a bit of agreement between you. Any questions or is that sound fun?"
T001,43.35,49.56,6.21,"Sounds good. OK, so our first question is, name something that people are often chased by in movies."
P061,53.79,54.38,0.59,The police.
T001,55.11,56.27,1.16,"Yeah, the police is one of them."
P034,56.89,57.63,0.74,Ghosts.
T001,58.58,59.81,1.23,Ghost is close to 1.
P160,61.06,61.91,0.85,Monsters then?
T001,62.22,63.2,0.98,"Yeah, monsters."
P153,63.51,64.02,0.51,Muscles?
T001,64.5,64.85,0.35,Yeah.
P153,65.47,68.26,2.79,I guess zombies will be repeating monsters.
T001,65.61,66.26,0.65,So it's a.
T001,67.83,70.28,2.45,"Yes, all zombies will be monsters as well, so."
P153,70.72,71.21,0.49,Fight.
T001,70.93,73.62,2.69,We have police and we have a monsters.
T001,75.2,75.96,0.76,Look for another.
P153,78.77,79.18,0.41,Books.
P061,80.35,80.91,0.56,Cash.
T001,82.23,82.67,0.44,Sorry.
P061,82.87,83.6,0.73,Cares.
T001,84.21,87.48,3.27,"Cars, yeah, that's our third one that we're looking for."
T001,89.03,97.76,8.73,"So we have police. We have monsters and we have cars, but now the more difficult thing is what's the ranking from most popular answer to the least popular answer."
T001,101.26,104.09,2.83,And you do need to like agree and give me an answer as a team.
P034,105.69,108.12,2.43,I'd say monsters would be the most popular.
P153,109.1,109.49,0.39,Eric.
P034,110.08,113.01,2.93,Because it includes all of type of monsters.
P153,118.17,123.67,5.5,Then I would. I would say cars maybe and then police or the other way round.
P160,122.38,123.49,1.11,"Yeah, I think so."
P061,125.19,126.55,1.36,"No, go for that."
P160,125.48,128.27,2.79,'cause I think I I thought of cars.
P061,129.12,129.61,0.49,1st.
P160,129.2,129.53,0.33,Pretty.
P160,130.17,133.36,3.19,"Pretty soon as well, so probably second that."
P034,134.02,134.33,0.31,Yeah.
P153,135.28,135.64,0.36,OK.
T001,136.08,140.29,4.21,"OK, so there's a good bit of agreement that we should go monsters then cars and then police."
P034,141.66,142.09,0.43,Yep.
P153,141.83,142.32,0.49,I think so.
P061,142.01,142.54,0.53,Suzuka
T001,143.45,146.36,2.91,"That's good. 'cause that's right. It is monsters, cars and."
T001,147.94,149.73,1.79,"Officially down as cops, but I think."
T001,150.65,159.01,8.36,"You know police and cops the exact same thing, so that's one we're doing well. Our second question is name and instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."
P034,161.35,161.96,0.61,Violet.
T001,162.56,163.75,1.19,"Yep, violin is one of them."

T001,166.41,167.54,1.13,Flute is not there.
P034,168.26,169.01,0.75,Trumpet.
T001,169.78,171.06,1.28,Trumpet also isn't there.
P153,173.5,174.18,0.68,The cello.
T001,174.69,175.7,1.01,"Yeah, the cello is there."
T001,181.32,184.39,3.07,So we have the violin and we have the cello and we're looking for one more.
P160,185.95,186.48,0.53,Drums
T001,187.5,189.89,2.39,"Yep, the drums. The drums is the missing one."
P160,190.29,190.67,0.38,yes.
T001,191.92,194.21,2.29,"Sometimes one that people forget about, but it's definitely there."
T001,195.2,199.15,3.95,So we had the violin. We have the cello and we have the drums. But what's your ordering?
P061,205.0,206.77,1.77,Be inclined to put the drones last.
P160,207.2,207.71,0.51,Yeah.
P034,208.22,208.72,0.5,He
P153,208.45,209.06,0.61,I think so.
P061,209.08,209.57,0.49,It's.
P153,210.02,212.21,2.19,And then I will put the balance first in there.
P153,213.15,213.91,0.76,Almost everywhere.
P160,215.27,215.6,0.33,Yeah.
P061,215.68,216.47,0.79,Description.
P061,217.23,217.96,0.73,Cello in the middle.

T001,220.12,224.17,4.05,"Pretty pretty quick to reach some consensus here, we're going for violin, cello, and drum."
P034,225.02,225.41,0.39,Yep.
P153,226.24,226.6,0.36,Yep.
T001,226.59,232.04,5.45,"Which is a good thing. 'cause that's correct as well, so we're two for two doing very well."
P153,231.49,231.82,0.33,Cute.
T001,233.26,247.47,14.21,"So if we move on to our third question, let's see if you can get this one name, a public place where you are likely to catch a cold or flu with the note that this was asked pre pandemic so everywhere isn't isn't on the list."
P160,248.83,250.44,1.61,At school.
T001,251.24,252.35,1.11,"Yep, School is one of them."
P153,253.67,254.79,1.12,A public transit.

P034,265.79,269.09,3.3,Or something like this or that's already transferred.
T001,268.81,270.06,1.25,"Sorry, can you say that again?"
P034,269.94,272.07,2.13,Like a boss or something like this.
T001,272.56,274.75,2.19,"Think tank transport, but it's not bus."
P160,275.32,276.65,1.33,A train or subway.
P034,275.67,276.61,0.94,Train then.

T001,283.71,285.92,2.21,"So we have school, hospital and airplane."
T001,286.61,287.63,1.02,But what's the ranking?
P034,293.52,296.95,3.43,"School would be first choice, but I don't know."
P153,296.49,296.81,0.32,Yeah.
P160,298.28,301.97,3.69,"Well, hospital makes more sense. I don't think you wrote it like."
P034,302.37,304.04,1.67,"Yeah, but we don't go off in there."
P160,304.16,304.57,0.41,True.
P034,305.62,310.77,5.15,And to school like you know you bring your kids over there and we were at school at some point as well.

P153,336.22,348.29,12.07,"I'm I'm not sure about this. This order of hospital and airplane because I think as as Emma pointed out, we're not that often to the hospital, but we're more often in airplanes, so I'm not sure about that."
P034,351.09,352.1,1.01,That's true as well.
P153,351.83,352.16,0.33,But
P160,354.38,355.95,1.57,Airplane is really specific.
P061,356.91,362.36,5.45,"Yeah, I feel people if they're thinking about being sick. Favorably inclined to think hospital."
P160,357.26,357.63,0.37,As well.

T001,552.27,560.02,7.75,"Uhm, so we had household chores, parenting and we have manners, but what's the ordering from most popular to least popular?"
P160,567.58,571.08,3.5,This is a hard one because it took us a really long time to get all three.
P153,571.19,571.67,0.48,Yeah.
P153,574.43,580.8,6.37,"But I thought that parenting was like must be really popular, like I think it's a very good option. But what do you guys think?"
