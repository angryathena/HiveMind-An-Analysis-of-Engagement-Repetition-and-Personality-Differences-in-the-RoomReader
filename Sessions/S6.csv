T002,38.14,52.59,14.45,"That all good. OK, I'll give you guys an example. Actually just to get like one of the questions could be named something people are afraid of and you could say things like spiders heights or other people."

P056,70.77,71.02,0.25,Yeah.
T002,73.95,75.26,1.31,"Oh no, just like."
T002,75.9,76.99,1.09,Because of someone.
P045,75.93,77.68,1.75,Just call our answer or something.
T002,78.0,89.88,11.88,"Yeah, if someone interrupts you, if you want to chat to someone, you can address them by their their like pseudonym thing. So yeah, just just say whatever whatever you feel."
P045,84.73,85.07,0.34,Cool.
T002,90.95,97.36,6.41,"OK, uh, first question name something people are often chased by in movies."
P045,100.03,100.73,0.7,The killer.
T002,102.36,108.99,6.63,"That's not on the list, but yeah, keep going eventually. If you keep shutting things out, one of them will be on there."
P056,102.87,103.33,0.46,Yep.
P045,104.21,104.62,0.41,OK.
P056,108.23,109.14,0.91,A monster.
P015,109.5,110.39,0.89,The question again.
T002,110.0,115.76,5.76,Monster at yeah. A name something people are often chased by in movies.
P032,117.33,117.89,0.56,Car.
P015,118.46,119.31,0.85,Uhm?
T002,119.06,127.55,8.49,"Riley said monsters there as well. Are you said cards. Those are both on the list, so that's great. You got to that you got two out of three that was really quick."
P032,119.14,119.45,0.31,Car.
P056,119.5,120.65,1.15,Yes she would.
P056,124.61,124.98,0.37,Right?
P056,127.49,128.1,0.61,Dirty.
T002,129.02,133.29,4.27,"OK, so there's one more, so we've got. We got monsters, we got cars."
T002,134.14,138.49,4.35,What else do people get chased by infills? Try and think of films you recently seen.
P015,139.34,140.6,1.26,Buy some.
T002,140.18,141.97,1.79,"Yes please, sorry."
T002,143.23,145.53,2.3,"You're on fire, uhm police?"
T002,146.31,156.76,10.45,"Is yeah, they actually said cops. I think this is a survey taken in America maybe but yeah, cops is on the list as well. Sorry. What were you going to say Harper?"
P015,157.9,159.67,1.77,"Oh no, no, it's fine."
T002,161.35,174.58,13.23,"Yeah, well, first thing. So you got those three of them. Uh, said monsters first, then cars and then police. Or cops. I think so. Now what order do you think these are in terms of most popular answers?"
T002,175.39,176.9,1.51,The people said in the survey.
P045,178.83,179.56,0.73,Kakar
P045,181.12,181.57,0.45,maybe?
T002,182.1,182.75,0.65,OK.
P032,183.2,187.61,4.41,I think maybe a monster 'cause she's kind of implies like.
P056,184.72,185.47,0.75,Yeah.
P015,185.74,187.18,1.44,"Yeah, monster."
P056,186.69,187.58,0.89,I think that's fair.
T002,188.49,189.3,0.81,OK.
P032,189.4,189.77,0.37,No.
T002,189.92,196.23,6.31,They kind of have three for us. There will be cards like you make your case for car. Why do you think ours is the most popular?
P045,195.65,209.64,13.99,"I don't know. I think it's like the most traditional one, like a high speed chase or something like that, or I don't know like I don't remember any monster movies. I don't think I'll watch any monster movies so I wouldn't really know."
T002,199.74,199.98,0.24,Yeah.
T002,207.92,210.11,2.19,"OK, so you're biased."
P045,211.2,212.62,1.42,"Right, that's scared of monsters."
P056,214.45,215.2,0.75,With him
T002,214.95,217.15,2.2,"Alright, so let's just avoid monster movie."
P032,215.61,216.44,0.83,Some cars are.
P032,217.31,226.3,8.99,"Yeah, I feel like police and cars are like very much the same like I would get like a car chase like one of them would be the police as well."
T002,221.05,221.76,0.71,Yeah.
P056,222.08,222.82,0.74,yeah.
T002,226.03,241.68,15.65,"Yeah, that's true actually. I guess the yeah the thing about these answers, they don't necessarily make sense. It's just like what people said alpha top of their head when they were asked so. But yeah, cops cards. I feel like a car chase just is often a cop chase as well."
P056,241.52,242.11,0.59,Yeah.
T002,243.73,251.01,7.28,"So wait, what did we say? So we think you guys are thinking monsters is probably your number would."
P056,252.29,252.84,0.55,Yeah.
P056,253.95,260.62,6.67,"'cause like I feel like I just like when you like, ask the question like the first thing that came to my head was like a horror movie."
T002,253.98,255.01,1.03,All agreed on that.
T002,261.25,261.76,0.51,Yeah.
P056,261.33,263.86,2.53,So I was like thinking sort of like monster.
T002,264.49,269.82,5.33,"Yeah, that's true and you said it pretty quickly as a like a system we've been signed."
P056,264.79,265.69,0.9,"For it, yeah."
P056,269.39,269.83,0.44,Yeah.
P032,271.04,274.55,3.51,"Yeah, even Max. I'd like killer at first like I feel like."
P045,274.36,281.43,7.07,"Yeah, that's what I had in my head. Like if you've ever seen scream or what's that movie with the guy with the ghost face on, he goes on like."
T002,281.12,281.79,0.67,Oh yeah.
P045,282.49,284.76,2.27,"Like yeah, I guess he's a monster or."
T002,288.4,291.01,2.61,"It all depends on how you classify these things, I guess."
T002,292.31,295.33,3.02,So Monster number one anyway.
T002,296.11,297.84,1.73,"And after that, what do you think?"
T002,299.45,302.36,2.91,So we got a cops and cars.
P045,304.41,309.97,5.56,"Probably cops, maybe. I yeah, I just see them as a two of them as the same thing. Kind of like."
P015,305.53,305.82,0.29,Thanks.
P032,306.76,307.11,0.35,Earth.
T002,310.43,311.14,0.71,Yeah.
T002,313.78,316.03,2.25,It's hard to tell stories.
P032,314.11,315.86,1.75,But yeah.
P045,315.36,317.03,1.67,I'd say cops to be honest.
T002,318.58,319.05,0.47,Yeah.
P015,318.6,319.07,0.47,Yeah.
T002,320.45,327.95,7.5,"OK, you guys all think costs for the second one and that leaves cars is lost so monsters."
T002,328.92,330.33,1.41,Monsters cops cars.
T002,331.29,332.14,0.85,My launcher.
P045,334.2,334.53,0.33,Yeah.
T002,334.57,335.89,1.32,"Well agreed, OK."
T002,337.4,346.88,9.48,"I can reveal that the first one was right, but the other two were actually fixed red. So monsters is the most popular answer and after that was cars and then costs."
T002,348.27,354.06,5.79,"But yeah, I guess like they're so similar anyway, UM, it feels like they could have been in any kind of way there."
P032,354.32,356.88,2.56,"Yeah, that's also the order we like. Call them out and."
T002,357.3,358.05,0.75,Yeah.
P056,357.53,357.93,0.4,Yeah.
T002,359.76,361.21,1.45,Maybe that's like a tactic.
T002,363.75,367.0,3.25,OK you guys ready for question #2.
P056,368.03,368.38,0.35,Yeah.
P045,368.43,368.76,0.33,Yeah.
T002,370.03,373.62,3.59,"OK, name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."

P045,379.28,379.93,0.65,Piano.
T002,381.52,385.66,4.14,"Weirdly, piano is not one of them, but I would have said piano as well in my head."

P045,402.96,406.75,3.79,"Is a trumpet in there? I don't know if there are trumpets, no."
T002,405.24,408.86,3.62,"No, but again it feels like something that should be in there."
P056,411.68,412.93,1.25,A harp.
P056,414.29,415.82,1.53,That's not an orchestra is right now.
T002,416.38,420.09,3.71,"I feel like it is, but it wasn't on the top 3 answers."
P056,420.47,420.87,0.4,OK.
P015,421.59,423.4,1.81,"Uh, the trumpet."
P015,424.37,424.94,0.57,Victim

T002,521.91,523.92,2.01,Of the orchestra that we haven't mentioned.
T002,525.12,531.55,6.43,"So if you kind of had this string guys, the brass and or miss know anything that we haven't thought of."

T002,549.76,562.03,12.27,"Yeah, OK, so you got all three of them, it was. But yeah, by Lynn, Cello and drums for the top three and now you're gonna have to rank these again. So what do you think is the most popular? The most likely?"
P045,563.35,564.12,0.77,I almost think.
P056,563.42,564.65,1.23,It's a violin.
P015,564.97,566.1,1.13,I think what they knew.
