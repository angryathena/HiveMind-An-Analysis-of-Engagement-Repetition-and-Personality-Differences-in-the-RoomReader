T001,1.94,29.91,27.97,OK so hi everyone and thanks for coming. Today we're going to play a quiz so I'm going to ask you a question is asked 100 people and you need to give me the tree most popular answers to that question. And after you get the top tree I'm going to ask you to rank them from the most popular to least popular. So for example if I ask name something that people are afraid of the tree most popular answers might be other height or other people heights and spiders.
T001,30.54,36.22,5.68,"And the ordering will be spiders, heights. Other people. So does that make sense? Or any questions?"
T001,37.89,44.44,6.55,"OK, so we'll get on with our first question. It's named something that people are often chased by in movies."

T001,49.51,51.32,1.81,"Well, actually you can all collaborate."
T001,53.0,56.35,3.35,Especially towards the end you all have to reach a kind of consensus on the ordering so.

T001,72.25,76.73,4.48,"Monsters is one. Yeah, that's the one kind of related to serial killers, so monsters is one of them."

P128,153.37,158.5,5.13,we're talking about the most popular answer rather than the most popular actual.
T001,153.76,154.07,0.31,1.

P142,174.57,177.82,3.25,I sorry I would say cops as the first one.
P128,178.39,178.96,0.57,Do you think so?
P142,179.43,183.28,3.85,Yeah I do. 'cause I think like most the time and it drops.
P142,185.06,187.8,2.74,"Maybe I would, it's just my voice."
P151,186.14,192.02,5.88,"Well, it's about what people might guess. Do you think most people would say police or monsters?"
P142,192.79,202.1,9.31,"I say it's difficult in police, but if democracy votes and you guys say monsters, uncle monsters."
P128,203.16,212.77,9.61,I my vote would be on the top would be monsters 'cause that stuff came. Actually I'm aware 'cause the first thing that came to my mind it was an earthquake so I don't know.
P151,203.51,204.98,1.47,I'm thinking along the lines there.

T001,280.24,283.39,3.15,Drums right off the bat. You got the tree of them.
T001,285.01,288.5,3.49,So what will be the ranking from most popular to least popular?
P151,290.15,293.88,3.73,I'd imagine maybe that order. I don't know if anyone else anyone else.
P142,293.48,296.13,2.65,"Violent, what would it file in? What was it?"
P128,293.59,293.98,0.39,Yeah.

P151,305.76,306.51,0.75,That's pretty true.
P128,307.32,308.16,0.84,I see your point.
P151,308.52,312.79,4.27,But you think of a cello with an orchestra more than you think of drums. That was my thinking.
P142,308.66,309.14,0.48,Yeah.
P140,313.95,315.9,1.95,But how many people know cello?
P140,316.67,317.56,0.89,As an instrument.
P142,318.38,319.56,1.18,No
P128,323.87,324.8,0.93,I would I would.
P128,326.27,329.5,3.23,"I would stick to violin, cello, drums."
P142,329.6,331.06,1.46,OK good thing.
P128,331.28,333.35,2.07,Because from violin is easy to go to cello.

T001,343.07,352.28,9.21,"That's good, 'cause that's correct. It is violin, cello and drum, right? In the order that you gave them to me right off the bat. So that's one for two it's 142."
P142,344.54,346.41,1.87,"Yes, well done team."
T001,353.05,364.63,11.58,"Our third question is going to be name, a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu with the note that this is pre pandemic so everywhere isn't an answer."

P151,755.05,755.96,0.91,You caught me.
P128,756.94,759.97,3.03,Emergency and everything is around meat for me.
P142,761.21,763.92,2.71,I would say I would say hair is first.
P140,764.73,765.28,0.55,Yeah.
P142,765.5,768.17,2.67,Then paper that would be my suggestion.

P151,777.61,779.17,1.56,"Yeah, also they have lots of kids."
P142,777.97,780.1,2.13,"No, I know, but he does it regularly."
P128,779.18,785.15,5.97,"And parents parents see kids, cotton kid kids cotton doing stuff with it."
P142,784.74,785.25,0.51,Yeah.
T001,784.88,787.0,2.12,Really going with the parents angle here.
P142,786.99,787.48,0.49,Yeah.
P151,788.78,789.29,0.51,We really.
T001,788.85,792.42,3.57,So her is definitely first. I think you're all agreed on that.
P142,795.1,797.09,1.99,Then they made paper.
P140,796.11,798.88,2.77,I think your yummy meat paper.

P151,806.25,809.48,3.23,"I would have done paper meat as well, but I don't mind. I'm not that good."
T001,809.15,812.45,3.3,You're kind of divided now it's 2 two votes each.
P142,813.2,816.35,3.15,"I don't mind, as long as there's on top. Yeah, I don't really."
P142,817.74,824.79,7.05,But I would go like people who seem to be cutting me smaller than they would be cutting paper. That's my personal opinion.
P128,825.22,831.99,6.77,But I think going from cutting hair with scissors you know to cutting paper with scissors.
P151,833.71,838.03,4.32,"That was, that was my thinking and then cutting meats a different type of cutting, isn't it?"
P151,838.97,839.36,0.39,Yeah.
P142,839.38,844.4,5.02,"Yeah, fair enough. Yeah OK, if you want to do then, but then so her paper meets."
