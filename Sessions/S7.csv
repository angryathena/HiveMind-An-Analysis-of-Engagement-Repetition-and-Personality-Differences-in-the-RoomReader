P053,987.91,988.61,0.7,Yeah.
T002,988.36,998.19,9.83,"Yeah, I guess it's not. It's. It's like the cops cars thing it just it doesn't really make sense like they kind of overlap, but I guess it's just what came to people's mind."

T002,1022.71,1023.08,0.37,Yeah.
P046,1023.84,1029.64,5.8,"Now that it's like they're like, yeah, like that is like the kind of thing I guess they didn't, you know, but they didn't teach it out in school."
P003,1028.2,1028.76,0.56,Yeah.
T002,1030.96,1031.57,0.61,OK.
P046,1031.32,1033.37,2.05,I don't know. I'm honestly at a loss.
