T001,1.6,23.01,21.41,"Alright so hi everyone, thanks for coming today. We're going to be playing a quiz so I'm going to ask you a question that was asked to 100 people and you need to give me the tree most popular answers to that question. And after you get the top 3 answers, we're going to rank them from most popular to least popular. So for example, if the question was named something that people are afraid of."
T001,23.59,32.54,8.95,"You might say heights. Older people and spiders, so those would be the top tree and then you would rank them spiders, heights and other people."
T001,33.4,36.37,2.97,So do you have any questions on the format of this?
T001,38.45,46.12,7.67,"Nope, OK, brilliant. So our first question is going to be named something that people are often chased by in movies."
T001,52.01,53.12,1.11,So we have any ideas?
P071,54.72,55.63,0.91,Other people.
T001,57.13,59.42,2.29,"Yeah, but more specific maybe."
P071,60.56,61.05,0.49,Uh.
P114,60.92,61.48,0.56,Ehlers
P071,62.39,62.76,0.37,Yeah.
T001,62.88,67.11,4.23,"Killers getting close. Police is one, yeah."
P114,64.81,65.47,0.66,police
T001,67.96,69.05,1.09,So please is one of them.
P071,71.67,73.01,1.34,Monsters is some kind.
P030,71.78,72.37,0.59,Zombies.
T001,73.31,75.74,2.43,"Yep, monsters monsters is another one."
T001,77.65,79.9,2.25,So we've got monsters police.
T001,80.74,82.41,1.67,And there's one more that we're looking for.
P067,84.31,85.44,1.13,Cars limited.
T001,85.75,86.56,0.81,"Cars, yeah."
T001,87.94,93.67,5.73,So you know typical car chase type stuff. So we had cops.
T001,94.62,106.15,11.53,"Monsters and cars. Those are treated. You give me those at the top tree, so I'm going to ask you now to rank them from the most popular answer to the least popular answer needs to reach a bit of a consensus on this so."
P114,108.38,109.01,0.63,At.
P114,109.79,112.84,3.05,"I jumped first cars, police monsters."
P071,114.11,116.6,2.49,As in cars number one or cars Dimitry?
P114,116.89,118.0,1.11,Card number one yeah.
P071,120.11,120.88,0.77,Please watch.
P071,123.81,126.84,3.03,"Ah, I would have went the exact opposite, but sure."
P114,126.87,127.88,1.01,Really OK.
P071,129.27,130.9,1.63,"But then again, that's yeah."
T001,129.87,131.4,1.53,You're all going to have to debate it now.
P071,131.59,131.95,0.36,R.
P114,131.62,135.08,3.46,"Yeah, well, I mean it's not that I haven't seen a film about four years maybe so."
P071,135.6,137.0,1.4,"Yeah, uhm."
P067,136.57,139.56,2.99,"I I'm gonna say place first, but then carries in the monsters."
P067,140.44,141.0,0.56,Personally.
P114,142.34,142.92,0.58,Yeah.
P071,143.12,153.95,10.83,"Yeah, I I wouldn't. I wouldn't put carries number woman, that's just because I guess I'm thinking of like horror movies and stuff and it's not very often harming someone like, oh, there's a karakhamun free. It tends to be one of the other two, but."
P071,155.02,155.43,0.41,Yeah.
T001,155.16,157.57,2.41,"David, have you got any? Any opinions on this one?"
P030,157.79,158.6,0.81,"Yeah, well."
P030,160.24,165.63,5.39,Probably thinking more like a policeman or monster been in the top 2.
P030,166.8,169.88,3.08,Just thinking of the moves that would be made over the past few years.
P030,170.6,174.82,4.22,There's probably more instances of those occurring than a car chasing someone.
P030,175.68,176.29,0.61,So.
P030,177.03,177.86,0.83,I'll go for.
P030,179.31,182.94,3.63,"Yep, possibly the monsters, policeman and then car."
P114,185.91,186.38,0.47,Right?
P114,188.31,198.54,10.23,"Well, everyone is different. I guess my my my reasoning with the cars. I suppose maybe it's down to the kind of films I watch is like if you think about it in a in let's say a thriller."
P114,199.15,206.44,7.29,"Like I'm thinking Roman is a famous one, right? For example, there might be no police, but there definitely be a car chase."
P114,207.85,208.1,0.25,And.
P030,209.01,209.48,0.47,Good point.
P114,209.66,211.35,1.69,"Boss, you know?"
P114,212.59,219.26,6.67,"I mean, again, I, I don't know if if if if you guys don't. The other three of you are sure that cars are not number one. Well sure, what do I know?"
P067,222.72,229.11,6.39,"Well, I mean actually kind of accidental is the question, like like what would people rank more like the top three? Rather yeah."
T001,227.78,232.93,5.15,"Yeah, so we asked. We asked 100 people what would be the most popular so."
P114,230.98,233.03,2.05,"Oh yeah, good point man."
P067,233.42,239.8,6.38,"Yeah, so I mean, yeah, that part could be more cards, cases for police chases, but people wanted monsters for 'cause. My first thought was like serial killers."
P071,239.99,240.39,0.4,Yep.
P114,240.42,241.53,1.11,Yeah me too yeah.
P067,240.6,240.98,0.38,So.
P071,242.17,245.13,2.96,Then I don't. I feel like it.
P071,245.93,256.5,10.57,"Easier in movies to be like, you know, I carries a bit more autonomous like it's easier like to be scared if a person if that makes sense. So I would say monster people cars. So like Monster Place in cars."
P114,258.73,267.45,8.72,"In terms of popular still, Florida people would think of monsters placing cars here sure great. Yeah, based on that reasoning, you're absolutely correct. If it's, I'm very tired."
P071,262.22,263.59,1.37,"Yeah I think so, alright."
P071,265.43,265.71,0.28,Yeah.
P071,268.95,269.99,1.04,I think everyone is.
T001,269.01,274.22,5.21,As soon as we have a lot of agreement there is anyone got any disagreements about that order or things that change?
P071,270.72,271.17,0.45,Alright.
T001,276.59,281.26,4.67,"No OK, so just to be sure it's we're going monsters, police cars."
P071,281.47,281.85,0.38,Yep.
T001,283.72,291.93,8.21,"Almost you were you were very monsters is the first one. Monsters is the most popular, but it's actually cars and then police swapped over."
T001,293.45,300.05,6.6,"So I think you know, maybe the popularity of a couple of car chasing movies recently. I don't know. I haven't seen a lot of them either, but."
P114,300.7,303.4,2.7,Tennis backwards car chase in tennis.
T001,300.84,303.37,2.53,"We were close, but we've got another couple of questions."
T001,304.65,307.88,3.23,We've got another couple of questions and hopefully you get one of those so.
T001,308.61,310.86,2.25,Name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra.
P067,316.02,318.46,2.44,Is by limiting most the first one.
T001,317.78,319.59,1.81,"Yeah, violin violin is one of them."
P030,326.76,327.27,0.51,Cello
P114,326.83,328.48,1.65,"Do you think, yeah?"
T001,327.91,329.85,1.94,"Cello is another one, yet cello is another."
T001,330.79,331.86,1.07,So it's two out of three.
P114,337.55,341.22,3.67,"Flute with people say flute for that, so one of them now."
T001,339.83,341.6,1.77,"They didn't say flip for it, but."
P114,344.66,345.93,1.27,Channel piano.
T001,346.61,348.11,1.5,Not the piano either.
P067,351.99,353.68,1.69,For like a Trump owner Trump is.
T001,354.93,359.81,4.88,"You're getting closer by moving away from the stringed instruments, but it's not a trumpet."
P114,358.99,359.74,0.75,OBO.
T001,360.61,361.4,0.79,Not a Novo.
P114,364.18,364.71,0.53,God.
P030,367.31,368.93,1.62,Drum any percussion.
T001,368.46,371.61,3.15,"The drums, yeah. The drums, the percussion side of things."
T001,372.8,381.62,8.82,"Yet the drum is that the last one that we're looking for, so we've got violin, cello and drum in the order that you found them."
T001,382.64,384.38,1.74,What do you think is the most popular ranking?
P030,389.47,393.82,4.35,"One thing violin might be top, just because that's probably what we all thought of first."
P071,396.65,410.62,13.97,"I mean I, I was screwed with this question from the start. I had no idea, but like in the terms if we got one immediately and then like a minute break and then we got another and there's like 2 minutes and we got another. If we're assuming the people are similar cells, I guess it would be in that order, but I literally don't have a clue."
P114,411.63,412.15,0.52,Yeah.
P067,413.73,422.45,8.72,Yet drones at him underpin one that I was able to put piano or string instrument earn process with the first so.
P071,421.19,423.2,2.01,What wouldn't be my first thought at all?
P114,425.51,427.95,2.44,"Do we know anything about the people who answered these questions, Daniel?"
T001,429.83,431.98,2.15,We know that there was a hundred of them and that's about it.
P114,431.42,433.05,1.63,That there are the Alki right here.
P071,432.84,433.69,0.85,"Fair enough, fair enough."
T001,436.85,438.59,1.74,Just got a bit of a feel for it.
T001,439.63,443.27,3.64,I saw a bit of agreement that you know drone would probably be the last one.
T001,444.13,444.88,0.75,That you put them.
T001,446.19,448.7,2.51,"And it sounds like you want to put violin first, but."
P071,448.59,452.54,3.95,Yeah I yeah I. I think the order that we found them makes the most sense.
P114,453.84,455.7,1.86,"Thank you so much, thank you."
T001,454.41,455.62,1.21,Gabriel and David do you?
P067,457.33,458.35,1.02,"Yeah, I agree."
P030,457.57,459.4,1.83,"Yep, Yep, I'll go with that."
T001,458.76,459.59,0.83,"Yeah, yeah."
T001,460.82,470.15,9.33,"Good that you did, because that is the correct order. It goes violin, cello and drum. UM, think you're right considering golf violin right off the bat, it's probably going to go for first."
T001,470.82,472.76,1.94,So we're one for two at the moment.
T001,473.38,484.7,11.32,"Let's see if you can get #3, so name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu with the note that this was us pre pandemic. So the answer is not everywhere."
T001,488.19,488.59,0.4,So.
P114,489.53,491.0,1.47,Public transport the bus.
P067,491.8,492.19,0.39,The.
T001,491.97,498.08,6.11,"Think along those lines. The boss is not one, but think along those lines."
P114,493.14,494.24,1.1,"Oh, you're still playing?"
P114,496.54,496.79,0.25,Yeah.
P114,498.33,499.14,0.81,Stencil.
P114,500.58,503.47,2.89,"Sorry, I'll just mute the microsec where they're talking about how you excuse me."
P071,504.0,504.58,0.58,No worries.
P071,508.22,514.79,6.57,I guess either a train or there is that whole thing is like being on a plane and everyone like one person being sick and everyone getting sick.
T001,515.7,518.82,3.12,The app I'm going to give you that 'cause a plane is one of them.
P071,519.22,519.51,0.29,Oh
T001,519.7,520.95,1.25,All that recycled air.
T001,521.9,522.84,0.94,Plane is one of them.
P071,524.67,525.49,0.82,where else is?
T001,528.92,530.2,1.28,Hospital is another one yet.
T001,532.69,534.32,1.63,So we've got playing in hospital.
P114,537.32,538.01,0.69,The office.
T001,538.75,544.04,5.29,"Not the office, no, but getting close to it, you're sort of in that realm."
P114,544.25,544.79,0.54,Lift.
T001,545.42,546.39,0.97,Not a lift.
P071,546.64,550.31,3.67,See this this this. This shows I'm young 'cause I was going to say school.
P114,548.87,550.5,1.63,Leaving for the delivery man.
T001,550.86,553.28,2.42,School is the remaining one though.
P030,554.83,555.17,0.34,Well done.
P071,555.8,556.33,0.53,Hell yeah.
T001,556.89,566.1,9.21,"You know, I think I think we've all been there. Where come September? At some point in your life you could manage to get sick, but yeah, it was plain hospital and school."
P071,563.12,563.49,0.37,Yeah.
T001,567.49,571.28,3.79,So we're ranking them from most popular to the least popular.
P030,573.69,581.18,7.49,"OK, I personally think that maybe the public transport plane would be the top top on the go."
P030,582.9,586.51,3.61,It's just that's what everyone's mind would immediately levitate towards.
P114,584.77,585.24,0.47,Yeah.
P071,585.99,586.37,0.38,Yep.
P114,586.89,587.26,0.37,Yeah.
P071,587.13,587.44,0.31,Yeah.
P114,588.27,588.83,0.56,I agree.
P071,591.09,591.63,0.54,Ah.
P114,593.0,595.59,2.59,I think based on the logic that.
P114,596.6,597.98,1.38,We applied to the last one.
P114,599.21,599.76,0.55,You know?
P071,599.41,599.72,0.31,Yeah.
P114,600.73,604.68,3.95,Would it be a safe bet to say plain what was the other one and then school?
P071,604.92,606.85,1.93,Playing then hospital then school.
P114,606.18,608.71,2.53,"Yeah, playing hospital school. Yeah I don't."
P071,608.19,614.25,6.06,"Yeah yeah, I mean, yeah, probably public transport was like the immediate thought and then."
P030,614.35,614.6,0.25,Yeah.
P071,615.65,626.75,11.1,"Shows people are cynical. It's like what's the place you're going to get sick at hospital? Just immediately is the thing that comes to people's mind, but I yeah, I think probably playing house full school makes sense, but I don't know."
P030,621.46,622.06,0.6,"Exactly, yeah."
T001,626.52,628.33,1.81,Gabriel DNA opinion on this.
P030,626.57,627.4,0.83,Yeah you will.
P067,628.88,629.82,0.94,Anne.
P067,631.23,641.16,9.93,"Yeah, I think I mean I might be inclined to put many school before plane, but I think if it's public transport probably would come for all that as well. So I suppose plane probably first."
P067,641.98,644.29,2.31,"In that sense, and."
P067,645.19,646.77,1.58,I don't think everybody else kind of has.
P071,647.31,647.92,0.61,I mean.
P067,647.4,649.77,2.37,Is better executed in consensus?
P071,648.81,661.96,13.15,"I mean, I mean, there's validity to not do because also like there's probably parents and people like myself who's out. Just go for a bit, have probably experienced the absolute annoyance of cold and flu season. So like."
P067,662.45,662.9,0.45,Yeah.
P071,663.14,668.31,5.17,"They're all in the top trees that you could make an argument for any of them being number one, two or three respectively, like."
P067,668.02,669.12,1.1,"Yeah, that's fair, yeah?"
T001,673.33,674.82,1.49,So at a push.
T001,675.55,680.74,5.19,"Just to make sure that there was a bit of consensus on plane, then hospital in school, do I have that right?"
P071,680.88,681.52,0.64,"I think so, yeah."
P114,681.78,682.13,0.35,Yeah.
T001,683.05,687.83,4.78,"It's actually the other way round. It's it's school, hospital and then fine."
P114,685.67,686.26,0.59,No way.
P114,687.88,688.41,0.53,Wow.
T001,688.85,689.3,0.45,Yep.
T001,689.98,692.15,2.17,So maybe the 100 people that were asked for.
T001,693.53,696.86,3.33,"Out just out of school or parents, but other way around."
P071,695.36,695.81,0.45,Yeah.
T001,698.48,704.13,5.65,No worries so #4 is going to be named something that you do not learn in school.
P067,706.51,708.12,1.61,Add taxes. I think it's a pretty big one.
P071,708.22,709.91,1.69,That was my immediate thought as well.
P067,709.46,710.06,0.6,Yeah.
T001,710.61,714.55,3.94,"Think something close to that. It's not. It's not necessarily taxes, but."
P067,714.83,717.18,2.35,"Like budgeting, finance and financial planning, kind of."
T001,717.53,720.26,2.73,"Sort of, keep thinking along those like."
P071,720.93,724.02,3.09,His life skills two general like that's.
T001,721.62,722.19,0.57,Wines.
T001,723.35,729.0,5.65,"Life, life life skills is a little bit too general, but they all sort of. They all sort of center around."
P071,726.18,727.83,1.65,"Yeah, yeah."
T001,730.97,731.6,0.63,That's fear.
P067,731.16,734.28,3.12,How do I get a job or make a CV or something?
P071,731.96,732.35,0.39,Yeah.
T001,734.93,739.46,4.53,"Uh, no, you're getting colder from one of them anyway."
P067,735.49,735.91,0.42,No.
P030,740.499,741.269,0.77,Family planning
T001,743.57,748.45,4.88,"Yeah, you know I'm gonna I'm gonna give that 'cause it's parent thing is one of them."
T001,749.75,754.6,4.85,"Uhm, parenting is one that you don't learn in school, so that's that's one of them."
P071,754.96,756.31,1.35,Add person.
P114,755.8,760.79,4.99,"There's something that people are like obsessed with. That's like taxes, but it's not taxes."

P067,893.5,899.99,6.49,"And I kind of argue that like matter is kind, it is indirectly taught 'cause like he kind of taught to nothing, obey everything that your teacher says, but."

P114,900.7,902.07,1.37,"Yeah, yeah."
P071,901.69,902.08,0.39,I.

P071,920.89,921.26,0.37,I.
P071,923.72,929.43,5.71,I would probably say parenting is a fairly big one. 'cause we got that almost immediately.
P071,930.25,935.78,5.53,And then I'd say it's a toss up between manners and chores because we weren't too sure on either of those.
P071,936.52,937.3,0.78,Uhm?
P114,938.06,955.65,17.59,"It's difficult to determine, I think, because it doesn't really, really, does depend like who the 100 people were. Because if you do a random count of 100 people on the street in Dublin, you'll find 100 people for whom manners are very important to you. Find 100 people who for whom? Perhaps they're not, and I."

I for me I would definitely think the tours would be like #1, but I'm also very bad at it, but that's just a personal opinion like and I'm one person so I probably say chores, parenting manners."
P071,972.52,972.91,0.39,Yeah.
P114,976.51,978.17,1.66,If I were ranking them.
P067,976.87,982.21,5.34,"Yeah, I I'd have to agree with note on that one. Yeah, I would be exactly the same. I want to order firstly."
P071,977.67,978.04,0.37,Yeah.
P071,980.5,983.53,3.03,"Yeah, yeah, that makes sense."

P071,989.8,990.12,0.32,Yeah.
P030,990.589,992.299,1.71,And just thinking of possibly?
P030,993.489,995.679,2.19,"Obviously it depends on 100 people been asked, but."
P030,996.319,1000.819,4.5,"If it was a more younger age group, possibly they would have gone with parenting."
P071,1001.8,1002.27,0.47,Yeah.
P030,1002.579,1004.069,1.49,But but I know it's it's all.
P071,1004.4,1021.63,17.23,"Yeah, yeah, I guess chores printing banners makes a little bit more sense because there's a large amount of people who have had kids, and I'm sure most parents as someone who isn't one myself, probably had a God. If they only like know how to actually like, do some cleaning and I cooked it dinner or whatever, yeah?"
