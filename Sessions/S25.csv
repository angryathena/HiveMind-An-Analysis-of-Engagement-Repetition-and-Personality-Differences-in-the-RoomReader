T001,2.47,10.96,8.49,"OK so hi everyone, thanks for coming today. We're going to play a quiz so I'm going to ask you a question that was asked to 100 people."
T001,11.65,15.46,3.81,And you need to give me the three most popular answers together as a team.
T001,16.29,21.32,5.03,"After you get the top tree answers, I'm going to ask you to rank them from the most popular to the least popular."
T001,22.39,30.06,7.67,"So for example, if I asked name, something that people are afraid of, you would say maybe heights, spiders, other people."
T001,30.76,35.31,4.55,"And then from most popular to least popular, it would be spiders, heights, other people."
T001,36.27,37.34,1.07,Any questions?
P169,38.46,39.48,1.02,Team straightforward.
T001,39.74,43.55,3.81,"Simple enough, yet you do have to reach consensus on the order."
T001,44.19,52.48,8.29,"But you know, as a team you can. When you get one right? I'll tell you so. Our first question is named something that people are often chased by in movies."
P173,53.67,54.26,0.59,Cars.
T001,54.8,55.81,1.01,Cars is 1 yet.
P167,55.89,56.57,0.68,Zombies.
T001,58.1,59.75,1.65,Zombies is similar to one of them.
P169,61.07,62.06,0.99,Falling buildings.
P210,61.19,62.08,0.89,Dinosaurs.
P210,63.04,63.71,0.67,What is the answer?
P173,63.1,63.71,0.61,On streets.
T001,63.27,68.64,5.37,"OK, so so I had two people talking at the same time there, so can I get Gabriel 1st and then Liam?"
P169,67.38,68.3,0.92,Go ahead Jackson.
P210,69.75,73.62,3.87,"Uh, so zombies is similar to one, is it dinosaurs?"
T001,74.53,76.44,1.91,"Kind of similar, still Liam."
P167,76.87,77.14,0.27,Killer.
T001,79.33,80.48,1.15,"No, not serial killer."
P173,81.72,82.39,0.67,Monsters.
P169,82.15,82.58,0.43,Nope.
T001,83.14,85.31,2.17,Monsters yeah monster.
T001,86.15,90.09,3.94,So I suppose dinosaurs and zombies kind of come over the general umbrella.
P210,89.42,94.65,5.23,"Uh, so wait. So we've got cars, monsters, the police."
T001,93.83,96.9,3.07,"You're looking for the police, yet the police is the missing one."
T001,98.13,107.08,8.95,"So in the order that you gave them to me, that would be cars, monsters and police. But what is the ranking from most popular to least popular of those three?"
P210,110.02,113.51,3.49,"Again, I I wasn't talking about ranking, I was just adding in please."
T001,110.94,111.35,0.41,No.
P167,112.67,112.91,0.24,I.
T001,113.52,117.53,4.01,"No, no, no. That's just the order that you gave them to me. But what is the most like? What is the ranking?"
P167,118.19,121.79,3.6,"I think police might be number one I'm guessing, yeah."
P173,118.81,119.2,0.39,Come.
P169,120.83,125.76,4.93,"Yeah, I put the the animated things first and put cars in the bottom."
P173,126.81,132.28,5.47,Is the question what is the most common ranking that people give it or the actual ranking?
T001,134.32,139.01,4.69,You know what's the most common that people give? So the 100 people that were asked?
P173,139.36,139.87,0.51,OK.
P167,143.84,144.63,0.79,I'd say.
P169,147.69,156.08,8.39,"Police Lego police first, 'cause that's a John remove movie genre. The rest are kind of like you can have a horror and there's different things in the higher."
P167,149.36,149.65,0.29,Yeah.
P167,150.79,151.18,0.39,Yep.
P167,155.06,155.35,0.29,No.
P169,156.83,157.16,0.33,But
P167,158.04,160.98,2.94,"Police, monsters, cars could that weird."
P169,158.24,159.24,1.0,Lisa John ray.
P169,161.06,161.55,0.49,Yeah.
P167,161.92,162.84,0.92,What do you guys think?
P169,163.73,164.86,1.13,I'd be with Luke on that.
P210,165.3,168.37,3.07,"Sorry, couldn't there. For a second you were working on the order ID."
P167,168.81,174.72,5.91,"Young, so Liam and I were thinking of police monsters and then calls as the order."
P169,168.82,169.28,0.46,Yep.
P210,175.34,178.71,3.37,"He's mostly 'cause yeah, yeah, I think that sounds about right."
P173,179.38,182.29,2.91,"I think I'd go with cars, then police, then monsters."
P169,183.48,184.91,1.43,Why can't stress tests?
P210,183.56,184.41,0.85,Bikers
P169,186.29,189.26,2.97,It's not specific. It could be like police cars or.
P210,186.32,187.79,1.47,do you think my cars were just?
P173,187.65,189.85,2.2,Was like places the last email photos.
P169,193.83,196.5,2.67,"But like besides police cars, what other cars are chasing you?"
P210,198.87,204.56,5.69,So are you thinking by cars? You mean all current chases?
P173,203.67,205.68,2.01,Like the generic car chase like.
P210,205.88,213.58,7.7,"Yeah, yeah, I'd say yeah. I mean like any film, any film where there's bad guys getting chased by the police."
P210,214.68,217.41,2.73,Versus any film where there's anyone getting chased in cars.
P167,219.45,228.19,8.74,"So actually that makes sense, right? Like a lot of times like follow that car and like you in a taxi or in somebody else's car or anything, and it's."
P167,228.9,230.77,1.87,Might be more common in the police I guess.
P210,231.52,232.05,0.53,Yeah.
P210,234.85,237.64,2.79,"Yeah, So what do you reckon? Are you saying Jackson? Are you saying?"
P210,238.27,242.17,3.9,"Cars please dinosaurs or not, don't search is monsters."
P173,242.37,243.82,1.45,"Yeah, that's what I would have pushed."
P210,245.23,245.78,0.55,OK.
P210,246.88,247.65,0.77,And.
P167,247.07,247.48,0.41,Yeah.
P210,248.6,249.81,1.21,"Yeah, I'm probably happy with that."

P167,251.06,252.4,1.34,"Yeah, same, I'm happy with that."
T001,252.72,254.81,2.09,"So just to confirm, we're going for."
T001,256.01,258.7,2.69,"Cars first, then police, then monsters."
P167,257.19,257.62,0.43,Yep.
P167,259.48,260.01,0.53,Yes.
P210,259.81,260.27,0.46,Yeah.

T001,265.0,268.25,3.25,Monster movies a classic staple.
P210,268.44,269.61,1.17,There's just so many of them.
T001,269.77,272.93,3.16,"Yeah, maybe not. Some, maybe not so much anymore, but."
P210,270.64,271.93,1.29,"My dear, we already."
P210,273.59,276.38,2.79,"Yeah, it was really monsters with a darker stain."
T001,273.85,276.22,2.37,"No worry, no worry. We've got other questions."
P169,276.8,277.43,0.63,Tell me.
T001,277.03,277.44,0.41,Yeah.
T001,278.28,282.87,4.59,"We have other questions, so name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."

T001,294.19,299.86,5.67,"Again, this question was also hundred people, So what were their answers was the most popular of their answers."
P169,299.57,300.36,0.79,Piano.
P210,300.63,302.4,1.77,Hey violins
P173,301.0,301.41,0.41,prove it.

P210,305.48,306.26,0.78,cello.
P210,307.37,308.11,0.74,Symphony.
T001,307.41,308.66,1.25,"You know, looking for one more."
P169,309.04,310.47,1.43,"Oboe, flute."
T001,310.3,311.8,1.5,"The oboe, not the flute."
P169,312.5,313.47,0.97,I'm very bad at this.
P167,313.89,314.57,0.68,Drums
T001,315.23,319.34,4.11,"Drums yeah, I was about to say you were actually quite close with the triangle, but you know."
P167,318.41,318.77,0.36,yeah.
P169,319.95,322.26,2.31,I was nowhere close with the triangle.
T001,323.57,326.09,2.52,It's a it's a percussion instrument I think.
P210,326.83,329.1,2.27,"Yeah, is it true? Is it drums or is a percussion?"
T001,328.65,335.82,7.17,"It is drums, it's drums, so the tree that you've given me are violin, cello, drums."
P210,330.17,330.7,0.53,Drums
T001,336.46,337.43,0.97,But what's the ordering?
P169,338.03,340.72,2.69,I'm stepping out of this guys 'cause I I don't know anything.
P169,342.35,344.27,1.92,I will go over whatever you guys believe.
P210,350.2,351.31,1.11,I'd say.
P210,352.15,355.59,3.44,"I'd say violin, cello, drums."
P173,356.84,357.67,0.83,I agree.
P167,358.78,361.86,3.08,"Yep, yeah, I'd be happy with that violin, cello and then drums."

P169,362.47,365.4,2.93,"And I'm telling I'm totally with that, yeah?"
P210,365.37,366.62,1.25,The payment withdrawn.
T001,368.02,372.83,4.81,"Well, that's good because it is violin. Cello and drums were one for two for one for two."
P169,370.84,371.57,0.73,Yes.
P167,371.45,371.82,0.37,Yeah.
P210,373.14,373.73,0.59,Fans.
P169,374.5,377.64,3.14,"I think we've got the pattern here, I just I just shut up and everything."
T001,374.68,375.92,1.24,Made up for the first question.
T001,380.67,388.53,7.86,So our third question is name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu with the note that this was as pre pandemic.
T001,389.28,390.78,1.5,So everywhere isn't an answer.
P210,391.81,392.36,0.55,OK.
P173,393.21,393.92,0.71,Airport.
P167,394.68,395.61,0.93,Public place.
T001,395.22,397.5,2.28,Uh Airport is close to 1.
P173,398.97,399.7,0.73,Train station.
T001,400.56,401.85,1.29,Getting further away.
P210,403.35,404.2,0.85,Airplane.
P169,403.59,404.37,0.78,Thank you happy.
T001,404.55,405.44,0.89,"They were playing, yeah."
P167,404.87,405.91,1.04,Bus stops.
T001,407.21,408.72,1.51,"Bus stops isn't there, no?"
P210,409.46,410.09,0.63,Buses
T001,410.96,412.13,1.17,"No, not buses."
P173,412.49,413.12,0.63,Concerts.
T001,414.14,419.26,5.12,"Concerts isn't there either. All very good answers, but not their hospital. Yeah, Liam. Did you say something?"
P210,415.82,416.64,0.82,the hospital.
P169,415.91,416.76,0.85,Hospitals.
P169,418.72,419.19,0.47,Brilliant.
P169,420.13,421.9,1.77,I did hospital known I said it too.
T001,422.33,422.72,0.39,Yeah.
P210,422.73,423.46,0.73,Haha.
P169,426.68,429.73,3.05,The weather we got. We've got airplanes and hospitals.
P167,427.99,428.84,0.85,Classrooms.
T001,430.23,430.62,0.39,Yeah.
T001,431.66,432.85,1.19,Airplanes in hospitals.
P210,431.76,432.3,0.54,And.
P169,431.86,432.49,0.63,Right?
P169,433.29,434.02,0.73,Restaurants.
T001,435.19,436.32,1.13,"No, not restaurants."
P210,436.7,437.37,0.67,Trains.
T001,438.24,439.05,0.81,Not trains.
P210,439.99,440.36,0.37,Yeah.
P167,440.87,441.55,0.68,Classrooms.
T001,442.09,446.49,4.4,"Classrooms. Yeah, I'm going to give that 'cause school school is the last one."
P167,445.99,446.78,0.79,"Yeah, school."
T001,448.2,456.3,8.1,"School and build one that you were missing. So I think in the order that you gave it to me, it's plain hospital school."
P167,457.33,457.74,0.41,Yep.
T001,457.59,459.98,2.39,But what's the ranking from most popular to least?
P169,461.58,463.01,1.43,I'm gonna say hospital first.
P210,463.57,473.72,10.15,"Yeah, I think I think you're right. Then I'd say hospital school plane 'cause I don't pray for me anyway. Pain doesn't come to mind first, but it does make sense. I mean, think about it."
P169,470.39,470.8,0.41,Yeah.
P169,474.5,477.51,3.01,"Yeah, I think it's one of those things where it leaks with the plane you don't know."
P169,478.16,482.79,4.63,"Uh, like whether you've got a cold or you've got some other thing due to."
P169,483.7,486.6,2.9,I don't know what is jet lag or whatever you might mistake it as.
P210,485.42,485.96,0.54,Yeah.
P210,487.34,487.85,0.51,Yeah.
P169,487.7,493.82,6.12,And all these all these travel vocabulary words I've completely lost of the last. Like what is that thing called?
P210,491.28,491.83,0.55,Yeah.
P210,495.58,496.39,0.81,And.
P169,495.92,496.48,0.56,So yeah.
P169,497.14,504.66,7.52,"So I'd go with hospital a school, but Luke said and airplane."
P210,497.23,498.16,0.93,Yeah so.
P169,505.3,506.96,1.66,Would be my suggestion.
P210,508.77,509.88,1.11,"Yeah, I'm happy with that."
P167,509.92,510.24,0.32,Yeah.
P167,511.11,520.49,9.38,"I don't know I. I feel like airplanes would be, uh, like me airplanes might be #1 just 'cause I mean it's it's a metal tube which is air locked and I mean."
P167,521.36,535.09,13.73,"That might be the scareware like for any other area like it's I mean open rooms like open air and you can kind of get away from somebody if they have a cold. An airplane you're like strapped, your seat like if somebody sneezes next to you, you're stuck with them."
P210,530.25,530.88,0.63,Yeah.
P210,537.09,548.02,10.93,"Yeah, that's an interesting one. I'd say I'd say before airplanes, probably not before airplanes. Before the pandemic I wouldn't have thought of airplanes or, like you know, is a real risk."
P210,548.79,550.18,1.39,Place for whatever reason.
P210,550.95,551.68,0.73,And.
P167,551.67,552.44,0.77,"That's right, yeah."
P210,552.82,565.51,12.69,"And I would have always thought of hospitals is like, you know there's there are a lot of sick people there, and there's also disease which only pretty much only exists in hospitals, you know. And but you might be right. I don't know, you know, that's that's just my opinion."
P169,562.11,563.7,1.59,Yeah there is.
P173,566.24,578.63,12.39,"I would have thought a hospital is risky and then a school is just like an office. No riskier, and then an airplane would've been riskier as well because it's an enclosed box with everyone breathing the same air. So I would have gone hospital, airplane and then."
P173,579.25,579.9,0.65,It's cool.
P167,581.17,584.19,3.02,"Yeah, I think I'd agree with that. Yeah, hospital airplane and then school."
T001,585.58,588.15,2.57,"OK, so we got two for hospital airplane school."
P210,586.12,586.57,0.45,Yeah.
P210,589.38,590.27,0.89,Anne.
P210,591.37,594.34,2.97,"Yeah, yeah no. I'm actually good at an."
P169,593.84,594.33,0.49,Yeah.
P210,595.13,599.98,4.85,"Yeah, I'd be. I'd be curious to be curious. Yeah, I might do that. What do you think I am?"
T001,598.6,598.97,0.37,Yeah.
P169,601.24,617.22,15.98,I did like I don't know how they ask the questions. I think my my curiosity would be whether or not like they actually get it in the place or they think they got it in the place. But that's I have no idea how to gauge that so I'm OK with how it is now. What was it? Hospital airplane?
P169,618.21,620.3,2.09,"And that was like school, yeah?"
T001,618.53,619.3,0.77,And then school.
P169,621.3,622.21,0.91,"That's what it was, yeah?"
T001,622.6,625.7,3.1,"OK, you're going to kick yourself because it's school hospital in airplane."
P210,623.01,623.41,0.4,Yeah.
P167,627.12,627.55,0.43,Oh
P169,627.93,629.92,1.99,If the new kids were so.
