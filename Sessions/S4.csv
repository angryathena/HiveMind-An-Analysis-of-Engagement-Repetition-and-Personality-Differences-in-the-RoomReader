T001,10.58,19.95,9.37,"And after you get the top tree answers, I'm going to ask you to rank them. OK, so you're going to reach a consensus as to what's the most popular to the least popular of those tree."
T001,21.38,25.81,4.43,And then we'll move on. So do we have any questions on that so clear?
P012,27.75,28.24,0.49,Yeah.
T001,28.03,31.22,3.19,I'm going to take you. I'm going to take your silence as a yes and listen so.
P036,28.16,28.55,0.39,Yeah.
T001,32.15,36.9,4.75,The first question is named something people are often chased by in movies.
P036,39.07,39.6,0.53,Zombies.
T001,40.88,45.97,5.09,"Zombies, I'll accept 'cause some monsters that the more generic monsters is one of them."
P016,46.98,47.58,0.6,Dogs.

T001,64.06,71.59,7.53,"People is a bit generic, but you know, I suppose that the top well the other Terry answer is a type of person."
P016,73.47,74.0,0.53,Police
P036,73.87,74.22,0.35,There.
T001,74.53,81.64,7.11,"Yeah, police so cops have got, you know I think we had monsters first in cars and cops."
T001,82.92,89.18,6.26,So those are the top tree and now I'm going to ask you to rank them from the most popular answer to the least popular of those tree.
P036,91.24,95.26,4.02,This is the most popular answer. The people say not the actual.
T001,94.6,96.23,1.63,"Yeah, so like we we."
T001,97.0,99.18,2.18,We asked 100 people this question and.
P036,98.44,98.89,0.45,OK.
P036,102.73,103.94,1.21,Where did you ask it?
P004,105.41,106.97,1.56,This is gonna be the first.
P036,105.41,107.32,1.91,Together contextual information.
P012,108.36,117.05,8.69,"I think police must see, even though we couldn't. It was the last one we thought of. I feel like that happens to most in movies."
P012,118.1,120.37,2.27,Plus I knew a cheese tank.
P036,122.77,124.73,1.96,"If it was America, it would be please."

P012,125.9,126.59,0.69,Sorry.
P036,126.81,127.34,0.53,Right now.
P016,128.49,133.0,4.51,"oh sorry, yeah, I'll say it's the first step. Probably number one for police."
T001,136.25,137.84,1.59,"OK, what about the other so?"
P036,136.89,137.2,0.31,Yeah.

T001,144.74,145.38,0.64,Sorry to you.
P004,147.14,155.71,8.57,"You're also just wondering if those men who answered it off, or women who answered, but then it's it's it's what's being popular in the film industry recently, isn't it?"
P004,157.25,162.92,5.67,"Like the last film I saw, was having to clear I saw dust."
T001,164.99,165.74,0.75,I think we've.
P004,165.05,171.0,5.95,"Monsters because from Resident Evil and all that with monsters, zombies."
P004,171.78,173.75,1.97,That was a popular film or just I liked it.
T001,176.0,176.53,0.53,So.
P012,176.93,181.73,4.8,I'd go for that number 2 then if you think that's reasonable and then.
T001,177.24,177.53,0.29,With.
T001,179.33,179.72,0.39,OK.

P012,188.89,191.94,3.05,there is no other no other options for those.
T001,190.62,195.99,5.37,So you're going to go with cops first monsters and then cars.

P012,204.91,206.8,1.89,"By the way, can we?"
T001,205.78,214.79,9.01,"It's actually monsters, cars and then cops, so I suppose the twenty 10s with the pleasure of zombie movies has skewed. That's somewhat but."
P012,215.9,216.93,1.03,"OK, don't."
T001,216.15,219.54,3.39,"No mind we've got. We've got another two questions, so hopefully you can get these two."

T001,305.0,307.58,2.58,I'm going to say tank of like the lesser.
T001,309.35,312.64,3.29,"Not lesser known as it's obviously quite popular, but one of the overlooked."
T001,313.55,314.86,1.31,Sections of an orchestra.
P036,316.83,317.46,0.63,Like a.

T001,339.09,343.05,3.96,And now we're going to rank them from most popular to least popular.
P036,343.85,344.85,1.0,The order is entered in.
P012,345.04,348.41,3.37,yeah I feel I feel best in the right order also.
P016,345.29,345.62,0.33,Yeah.
P036,347.7,348.32,0.62,Yeah.
T001,348.85,352.38,3.53,"I think that's wise considering how quickly you got the first two, and then not the third one."
T001,353.95,355.4,1.45,It's good because it's right.
P012,356.11,356.57,0.46,Yes.
T001,356.38,358.35,1.97,"It is violin, cello and drums."

T001,359.09,360.56,1.47,So we've got. We've got one under 2.
T001,361.63,371.36,9.73,"Alright, so this third one is interesting. It's name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu, and I'm going to say this was asked before the pandemic."
T001,372.31,374.21,1.9,So this is back in the before times.
P036,372.72,373.35,0.63,Train.
P012,373.76,379.16,5.4,Just does public transport count or is it more of a space that we're looking for?
T001,378.36,381.93,3.57,"Uhm, think along the lines of public transport for one of them."
P036,382.84,383.5,0.66,Train.
T001,384.1,385.47,1.37,Not a train now.

P004,394.46,397.38,2.92,"Planes of the planes. The safest transport, isn't it?"
P012,395.54,398.87,3.33,"Yeah, uh, yeah, planes."
P036,395.74,396.49,0.75,No plane.
T001,397.89,398.7,0.81,"It is, yeah."
T001,399.47,404.34,4.87,But not if you're looking to stay healthy from a cold or flu. I suppose plane is one of them.
P036,405.11,405.84,0.73,The bar.
T001,406.87,408.26,1.39,Now a bar isn't one of them.
P004,407.71,410.34,2.63,"Ever for cover, two is the safest."
P012,409.79,410.88,1.09,Like a school.
T001,411.28,412.31,1.03,"I know, yeah, but."
P012,411.6,412.15,0.55,Where?

P016,425.09,425.6,0.51,Hospital
P036,425.68,426.31,0.63,Said Marcus
T001,426.69,439.2,12.51,"Yes, a hospital, a hospital, supermarket, and bar is also very good one, but a hospital is the last remaining one, so we had plain school and hospital."
P012,426.7,427.59,0.89,Constant.
P012,429.56,430.22,0.66,Nice.
T001,440.18,441.25,1.07,And now we're going to rank them.
P036,443.55,445.56,2.01,you just didn't say more effectively.
P004,446.76,449.27,2.51,There isn't a whole season hospital going to be higher.
P036,447.25,447.73,0.48,It's not.
P036,449.01,449.69,0.68,"Yeah, baby."
P012,450.57,451.49,0.92,Full of sadness.
P036,453.01,453.77,0.76,It's the.
T001,454.94,457.29,2.35,"Yeah, it's based on people's opinions so."
P012,454.96,455.67,0.71,I don't know.
P012,458.13,462.48,4.35,"And like we didn't think of us like it initially, I don't know though."
P036,461.11,461.42,0.31,With.
P036,463.14,469.0,5.86,"We're primed by COVID, though, to think of day-to-day places everywhere is dangerous."
P012,463.33,464.2,0.87,I'm not sure.
P036,470.83,471.49,0.66,Jeff
T001,474.72,478.45,3.73,Maybe if you could think of what your the top one would be and then work your way down.
P012,479.09,483.2,4.11,I am sure we do what everybody thinks the top one is.
P012,484.25,484.75,0.5,Maybe?
P036,486.92,492.56,5.64,"it's a hospital because it's obvious, but then it's so obvious that maybe people don't think of it."
P012,492.24,494.99,2.75,"I would have said school, I feel like."
P016,494.28,495.31,1.03,I wasn't playing.

P036,545.08,545.87,0.79,Knock down.
T001,545.78,550.68,4.9,"If it was me, personally I'd say plain school hospitals. Well, 'cause every time I get off a plane I."
T001,551.64,552.56,0.92,"Feel terrible, but."
T001,554.08,556.42,2.34,"So unfortunately, we're not a tree. You got one."
