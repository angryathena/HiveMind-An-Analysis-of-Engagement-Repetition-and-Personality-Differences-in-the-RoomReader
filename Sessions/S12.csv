T002,0.68,2.68,2.0,Wait for the recording start.
T002,3.5,4.94,1.44,"Right, I think it's recording."
T002,5.9,14.07,8.17,So good afternoon and today we're gonna play a game that you might be familiar with if you ever watch the TV show Family feud.
T002,14.81,24.64,9.83,"It's a quiz game, so I'm going to ask all of you guys a question that was asked to 100 people in a survey and you have to guess the three most popular answers."
T002,25.32,31.55,6.23,"And once you got them, I'll let you know when you've hit on the best three, and then I'll feature like rank them in order of popularity."
T002,33.13,37.98,4.85,"So for example, if I ask you guys name something people are afraid of."
T002,38.91,44.56,5.65,"You might come up with spiders pipes on other people, which is why people said this service."
T002,45.9,48.93,3.03,So I thought that cleared up. Anyone got any questions about this?
T002,50.59,62.77,12.18,"Front, as in this scenario as well, you're working together so we can discuss them like I don't know, debate with each other if you don't agree with the order that you're putting in it or whatever. OK, so you guys ready for the first question."
T002,64.96,65.51,0.55,OK.

T002,87.06,88.62,1.56,Apple on the nurse but like.
T002,89.45,95.54,6.09,"The feeling it should be I guess is not necessarily the most correct of food, just both people said they were asked."
P073,97.08,98.19,1.11,I'm an animal.
T002,99.73,100.84,1.11,Hold on there either.

T002,115.62,122.85,7.23,They try to explore this zombie angle. That little boy is trying to think of what you see in like under a higher or sci-fi film.
P084,123.58,124.39,0.81,Oh ghost.
T002,125.2,127.44,2.24,Trump maybe like a more general term.
P082,127.8,129.09,1.29,Murder.
T002,130.27,130.98,0.71,What do you say?
P082,131.33,132.25,0.92,A murderer.
T002,132.32,137.0,4.68,"You know a lot of rare that smile there, but."
T002,138.09,145.63,7.54,"So I feel like zombies and ghosts kind of fall into an umbrella like a broader, broader name."
P099,145.45,146.29,0.84,Monsters.
T002,146.51,159.31,12.8,"Yeah, monsters OK great, so that's it. That's the third one. So we had cops cars from monsters so they were the top three and I'm gonna ask you to rank these in the order of most popular to least popular."
T002,160.68,162.2,1.52,What would you guys put as number one?
P082,165.79,167.51,1.72,Cars maybe?
T002,168.84,176.08,7.24,"Yeah, I feel like it all depends on what kind of movie you watch, what your first event, but your freaking say."
P082,169.95,170.5,0.55,I don't know.
T002,177.59,178.29,0.7,Cars.
P073,180.59,185.6,5.01,"He, like monsters, would be up there somewhere. 'cause like there's so many things that fall under that category."
T002,186.29,189.29,3.0,"Yeah, that's true. Actually. Monsters could also be free."
T002,190.73,191.73,1.0,Bluetooth speaker.
T002,194.38,196.16,1.78,What do you guys think? Hazel and Ella?
P084,200.34,204.99,4.65,"I'd probably say uhm, cars, please monsters."
P082,205.85,207.42,1.57,"Yeah, I would agree."
T002,208.87,209.43,0.56,OK.
T002,210.14,210.78,0.64,So.
T002,211.41,215.99,4.58,"Cars number one, then call them monsters."
P082,218.09,218.42,0.33,Sure.
T002,218.32,221.37,3.05,Are you cool with that or would you put monster player up?
P073,220.46,223.17,2.71,"Yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go with that."
T002,222.02,222.71,0.69,OK.
T002,224.51,227.21,2.7,Cars cost monsters.
T002,229.3,238.81,9.51,"OK, I can reveal that. Actually, monsters is number one, so monsters this phrase then cars then cost so you the right idea. There we get it."
T002,239.89,246.37,6.48,"But yeah, I feel like costing cards are kind of in the same category to kind of overlap cousin."
T002,248.01,250.54,2.53,"So yeah, I guess it really depends what type of films you watch."
T002,252.47,254.78,2.31,Lakers ready for the second question.
T002,257.34,261.15,3.81,"OK, name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."

T002,274.42,275.68,1.26,"Yeah, shadows out there."
T002,278.42,279.54,1.12,So two out of three.
T002,280.56,281.34,0.78,So one more.
P084,284.19,285.42,1.23,Maybe a flute?
T002,286.79,289.02,2.23,"I feel like flute should be, but only it's not."
P084,288.61,289.4,0.79,Yeah.
P099,291.59,292.28,0.69,Maybe?
T002,293.07,294.41,1.34,"No, it's not hard."
T002,297.42,299.45,2.03,Be funny if they were just all stringed instruments.
P084,300.35,300.75,0.4,Yeah.
P073,300.54,301.41,0.87,And over.
T002,302.5,303.18,0.68,No.
T002,303.8,304.6,0.8,Small in there.
P084,308.91,312.92,4.01,"Oh uh, xylophone know about some milk and stuff."
T002,313.02,315.35,2.33,"That's all there, but I don't know."
T002,316.18,316.7,0.52,Kind of.
T002,318.35,324.33,5.98,More in the xylophone direction and the overall direction. The last word yes drug.
P084,322.11,322.81,0.7,Drum
P084,324.57,324.9,0.33,oh

T002,331.48,336.87,5.39,"So we had violin, cello drum while or did you think he put pieces?"
P099,337.56,339.71,2.15,I feel like violin would be first.
T002,340.09,345.33,5.24,"Yeah, yeah, I guess that violent like instantly everyone kind of thinks, provided the buyer impressed."
P084,340.09,340.58,0.49,yeah.
T002,348.86,350.52,1.66,And then we got shadow and drum.
P082,352.81,356.27,3.46,Probably put cello and then drum 'cause it took us ages to get to drum.
P073,356.3,356.85,0.55,Yeah.
T002,356.63,361.87,5.24,"Yeah, yeah, I guess this one kinda makes sense like this. The order that you guys had to anyway."
P084,357.5,357.91,0.41,He
T002,362.88,367.85,4.97,"And I can reveal that it is the correct order. Violin, cello, drums."
P082,368.37,368.71,0.34,Kill.
T002,368.57,380.13,11.56,"Struggling with arguing and I feel like I never. I don't associate job so much with orchestras. He lets him put out more in this. I think more of live music or, you know, pop music Richard."
T002,381.7,385.41,3.71,"I think it's so weird that piano wasn't on there, but maybe that's just 'cause I play piano."
P082,387.02,387.39,0.37,Yeah.
T002,389.12,392.33,3.21,Right you guys ready for question 3.
T002,394.63,402.3,7.67,"I'm just gonna point out that this was asked before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, so bear that in mind when you try to think of the upstairs."
T002,403.34,407.43,4.09,Name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu bug.
P084,410.3,411.21,0.91,The irony?
P073,415.38,416.22,0.84,A school.
T002,416.71,418.14,1.43,"Yeah, feels out there."
T002,419.33,419.64,0.31,Right?
T002,421.49,427.18,5.69,"I always think of this too. I feel like everyone always used to get sick, so he's back to school the first day, September."
P084,425.43,426.16,0.73,Yeah.
P084,427.65,428.86,1.21,Especially with swine flu.
T002,429.8,432.09,2.29,"Yeah, it's not about that."
T002,433.52,446.33,12.81,"Under memory in primary school, I feel like there's an era in my like primary school thought everyone just had head lice all the time and we'd be living in fear of like getting in letters that would say so when in your class has had life."
P084,444.16,444.93,0.77,Oh
T002,447.06,450.26,3.2,Any wonder like who is it? Who is a potential deal?
P084,452.38,454.57,2.19,"oh, what about like a swimming pool?"
T002,455.41,459.72,4.31,"Apple on there, but so true. Let's see. Although like senior D."
P084,460.43,460.99,0.56,Yeah.
P073,462.65,463.5,0.85,A bathroom.
T002,465.03,466.73,1.7,"That should be all there as well, but it's not."
P082,467.85,470.2,2.35,I was thinking like public transport.
T002,468.47,469.52,1.05,Public bathrooms.
T002,470.58,473.55,2.97,Public transport is heading in the right vein.
P082,475.19,476.92,1.73,Me the bus.
T002,478.18,479.27,1.09,Versus mullner
P084,479.68,480.49,0.81,Oh an airplane.
T002,480.87,499.3,18.43,"yeah airplanes, airplanes on there. I feel like some airplane versus Bose is a very pre and post COVID kinda mindset like maybe before all of those people would have said oh God like you catch these from fireplace so you catch them on the airplane, whereas now we're lucky we got on the bus tickets. Are we going to get it?"
T002,501.69,507.04,5.35,"Everything is much more local on the House and told about getting on the plane. And like yeah, sure."
T002,509.14,512.78,3.64,So you got 2/2 out of three to cool airplane.
P073,515.01,516.3,1.29,How about a sharp?
T002,517.37,518.62,1.25,Shop isn't on there.
T002,519.32,519.75,0.43,But
T002,520.37,523.56,3.19,"again, it feels like a very fun and COVID answer like."
T002,525.11,527.52,2.41,For super paranoid about getting groceries.
P082,527.44,529.16,1.72,Is the hospital a public place?
T002,529.3,531.56,2.26,"Yeah, hospital hospital third of."
P082,531.72,532.17,0.45,OK.
T002,532.23,532.76,0.53,Of the.
T002,533.9,534.58,0.68,So.
T002,535.67,539.53,3.86,We had school airplanes on hospital.
T002,540.42,542.24,1.82,"What would be #1, do you think?"
P073,545.08,546.39,1.31,School maybe?
T002,547.12,554.19,7.07,"Yeah, I feel it. Still everyone kind of either went to school at one point for his child in school versus school."
T002,554.92,555.95,1.03,Maybe a lot of people to.
T002,559.31,560.48,1.17,Let's do number one.
T002,563.28,563.87,0.59,Then what?
P084,564.98,567.77,2.79,"I'd be inclined to put hospital second, just 'cause it."
P084,568.79,569.3,0.51,Pretty.
P082,569.38,569.82,0.44,Yeah.
P084,570.12,570.89,0.77,Obviously stuff.
T002,571.52,571.97,0.45,Yeah.
T002,573.07,575.4,2.33,And that would leave airplane codes.
T002,576.85,577.79,0.94,You guys happy with that?
P084,578.9,579.21,0.31,Yeah.
P082,578.95,579.27,0.32,Yep.
T002,580.26,584.31,4.05,That's the right right order again. So school hospital airplane.
T002,585.38,587.05,1.67,"Yes, it makes more sense."
T002,588.32,601.85,13.53,School is definitely such like a hotbed of infection. Every time I think it's true or like see agrees with primary school children walking around their face. They're like covered in dirt that I would felt like small hanging out of their nose unless they're like 4 primary schools.
P082,590.9,591.32,0.42,Yeah.
T002,604.75,605.4,0.65,OK.

T002,620.75,633.87,13.12,"I feel like that destiny should be on there. I think of that like the moment I wish some of I I feel like that OK maybe it's not on there, but I feel like that I'm like taxes and stuff or stuff. I always wish that others in school."
P084,640.67,641.91,1.24,This is kind of hard.
T002,641.82,642.52,0.7,Yeah.
P084,643.5,645.3,1.8,I feel like I learned everything in school.
P082,646.18,646.78,0.6,Oh God.

P084,646.33,647.05,0.72,And.
P082,648.48,649.73,1.25,I was going to say taxes.
T002,651.68,653.57,1.89,It's weird that taxes from there.
P082,656.25,656.89,0.64,Man.
T002,661.15,667.39,6.24,Try and think of someone like telling you like I'm sure you would learn that in school or what like. I know your parents when I said to you.
P082,669.79,671.57,1.78,Like how to make your bed?

T002,689.28,693.56,4.28,"Yeah, true, that's all OK. So what other three has toys?"
