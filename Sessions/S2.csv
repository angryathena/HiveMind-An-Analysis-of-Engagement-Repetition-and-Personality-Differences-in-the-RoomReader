P024,70.32,71.0,0.68,Ah.
P019,77.64,78.67,1.03,The bird goes.
P024,77.73,78.22,0.49,Uhm?
T002,79.64,82.63,2.99,The bad guys are afraid that's not on the list.
T002,84.79,87.12,2.33,"So we got one out of three, sorry."
P024,84.87,85.33,0.46,Jump.

T002,108.52,129.51,20.99,"Great, I was super quick and all right so we had cops first, then monsters, then cars and now try and order them and like the most from the most popular to the least popular. So which do you think comes first that most people would answer and remember? It's not necessarily the most correct one or something. It's just."
T002,130.1,132.09,1.99,The most common one most common unsafe.
P019,135.99,136.84,0.85,Police first.
P021,137.21,138.56,1.35,Get high tech though.

T002,141.94,144.89,2.95,"OK, so we're saying please first."
P021,143.09,143.5,0.41,And then.
P021,145.36,151.79,6.43,I think monsters would probably be last right because like it's just less harmful this out there in this horror movie fans.
P024,148.67,148.98,0.31,Yeah.
P019,150.5,153.79,3.29,Yeah I bought the please carries monsters.

T002,165.59,168.77,3.18,"Yes, people are just saying whatever the first thing that came into their head was."
T002,169.68,176.57,6.89,"Police cars and so we're saying police first, then cars and monsters."
P024,177.76,178.13,0.37,Yeah.

T002,242.59,254.36,11.77,"Christy are those are the three that everybody says that's great. OK, uhm you guys wanna rank these again? So which do you think was the most likely? Which is the least likely?"
P024,254.74,258.39,3.65,I said while in was the most likely because I did not.
P019,257.46,259.33,1.87,"Yeah, certainly the order we got them in."
T002,257.56,261.15,3.59,"Yeah, you said that pretty quickly, pretty instantly."
P024,260.25,266.59,6.34,"Yeah, and cello is probably the least likely. I say, you know, everybody doesn't think that immediately."
P024,267.4,271.57,4.17,"I see, so it's probably violin, drums, and cello."
P024,272.91,273.48,0.57,I think.

P024,279.5,286.31,6.81,"Or maybe yeah, it's more associated with orchestra and all. Maybe drums. Mikey lost you're right, you're right."
T002,288.68,289.66,0.98,So what are we saying?
P024,291.05,292.03,0.98,I can't decide.
P021,292.35,296.87,4.52,"I'm happy to go cello second as well. It makes it like it's it's Symphony, right?"
P019,292.45,293.08,0.63,I don't know.
P024,294.6,297.31,2.71,"Yeah Chelsea yeah I'm changing my mind, yeah."

T002,316.91,323.79,6.88,"Uhm yeah. Jones is an odd one. I thought it would be something else like the piano or something, but like I said, we're just says Jones."
T002,325.1,343.31,18.21,"Uh, all right now. The third question you're gonna have to bear in mind that this survey was taken before the coronavirus pandemic started, so just try to bear that in mind when you're thinking of the answers. So the question is name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu bug."
P027,347.97,348.81,0.84,The hospital.
T002,350.12,351.34,1.22,"Yeah, that's on the list."

P024,357.34,358.04,0.7,"School, yeah."
T002,358.53,359.86,1.33,"Yeah, that's fair as well."
T002,365.34,368.43,3.09,"Restaurants going, but it's not. It's not the third on the list."
P027,369.46,370.55,1.09,Public transport
T002,372.24,374.91,2.67,Public transport OK there is yeah.
T002,375.81,378.84,3.03,I guess that's kind of heading in the right direction.
P024,379.21,379.86,0.65,Buses
P024,382.26,382.76,0.5,bye bye.

T002,389.43,394.09,4.66,"Uh, the airports is closed. OK, just what what do you take from an airport?"
P024,394.14,394.78,0.64,Play.
P021,394.71,396.24,1.53,2nd.
T002,395.05,399.87,4.82,"Yeah, an airplane that was the that was the third one so."
T002,400.66,403.19,2.53,"Well, we have hospitals and schools and airplane."
T002,404.33,407.2,2.87,"No, I never think of planes really. I feel like."
T002,409.57,413.74,4.17,We think of it much more now that we're like totally bombed from flying anywhere.
T002,415.54,422.93,7.39,"OK, so we thought we had hospital first, then scheduled an airplane. What order are we going to rank these?"
P024,425.11,429.32,4.21,"I see the airplane is lost. Anyways, I like that, yeah."
P021,425.14,425.57,0.43,It has.
P019,427.6,431.27,3.67,"Airplane last death lady. I refuse to believe that's up there, but."
P021,429.52,429.97,0.45,Had it.
P019,432.41,432.76,0.35,I.
P021,433.4,435.53,2.13,"It has to be hospital first, right?"
T002,433.44,434.33,0.89,It is I'm not.
P019,435.74,437.37,1.63,Others had school 1st.
P024,435.74,436.16,0.42,Yeah.
P021,437.36,438.14,0.78,Mercy.
P024,438.19,439.58,1.39,School or hospital?
P019,439.28,443.61,4.33,"I mean, I would buy mine, went straight to the pub, but that's not really an option so."
T002,445.04,449.89,4.85,"Right, it's not on this list. I guess it's Americans that were surveys. Maybe they wouldn't cycle."
P019,449.11,449.92,0.81,To the bar.
T002,451.35,451.93,0.58,The bar.
P024,452.84,459.89,7.05,"I feel like it's cool, but I don't know. School is first like camp, I can't be sure though like don't blame me if it's not."
P019,455.91,458.18,2.27,"Ordered school first, then hospital."
P027,462.7,464.19,1.49,"Hey, I'm happy to go with school."
P021,464.23,465.65,1.42,"Yeah, I'm happy to put the group."
T002,466.33,466.96,0.63,OK.
T002,467.68,472.91,5.23,So that leaves so airplanes last goes 1st and then hospital in the middle.
P019,473.92,474.35,0.43,Yeah.
T002,474.31,477.71,3.4,"OK, that is also the correct order."
T002,479.42,482.48,3.06,"Well done, you guys already working together very well."
T002,484.02,491.61,7.59,"So quick, well, we're only been here like 5 or 10 minutes and you got through the three questions so."
T002,492.53,494.16,1.63,I guess that's the end of the session.
T002,499.52,505.07,5.55,"Well done everybody and thank you so much again for taking part because yeah, it really means a lot."
