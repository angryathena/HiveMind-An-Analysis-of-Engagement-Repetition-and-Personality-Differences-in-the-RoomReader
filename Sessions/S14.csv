T001,0.12,9.57,9.45,"Hi everyone, thanks for coming today. We're going to play a quiz so I'm going to ask you a question that was asked to 100 people and you need to give me the three most popular answers."
T001,10.2,20.36,10.16,"After you find the three most popular answers, I'm going to ask you to rank them from the most popular to the least popular. So, for example, if I said name, something that people are afraid of."
T001,21.0,31.07,10.07,"You might say other people, spiders and heights and then the ranking of most popular to least popular would be spiders heights, other people."
T001,31.86,32.4,0.54,Uhm?
T001,33.1,44.89,11.79,"You need to kind of reach a consensus, wish. The ordering of things, so there would be a bit of debate, but the interaction and hopefully you come to something you can all agree on. So do you have any questions?"
T001,47.26,55.37,8.11,Gotta take silence as a know. So our first question is name something people are often chased by in movies.
P092,58.23,60.27,2.04,Come to a car like a.
T001,60.62,61.8,1.18,"Yeah, cars is one of them."
P112,65.06,65.81,0.75,Valence
T001,67.63,69.24,1.61,Think close to villains.
P094,72.19,73.28,1.09,Murders.
P096,72.82,73.39,0.57,Monster
T001,74.06,77.26,3.2,Still still think kind of in those lines were not.
T001,82.05,84.04,1.99,'cause the very famous type of movie.
P096,87.9,88.51,0.61,shark
T001,89.6,90.99,1.39,Still close.
P092,92.18,93.89,1.71,"Monsters, I don't know."
T001,93.47,99.12,5.65,"Monsters yeah monster movies, so that's a that's another one. There's one more."
P094,101.0,101.59,0.59,Animals.
T001,102.61,103.37,0.76,No.
T001,114.41,118.7,4.29,"You said you said villains area. It's kind of very similar. Well, it's related to that."
P092,122.76,123.51,0.75,Enemy.
T001,124.65,125.71,1.06,Not quite.
P096,127.17,128.02,0.85,The bad guy.
T001,129.02,129.95,0.93,No.
T001,136.01,137.24,1.23,If you were a villain.
T001,139.02,140.35,1.33,What would you be chased by?
P094,142.42,142.93,0.51,The car.
T001,143.55,154.84,11.29,"Yeah, exactly the police. So those are the tree that we have. I think in the order you gave them to me it was cars, monsters and then you know cops or police so."
T001,155.46,158.79,3.33,Now you're going to try and rank them from the most popular to the least popular.
P094,161.78,163.11,1.33,It said there's a lot of like.
P094,165.25,166.57,1.32,Police dramas
P094,167.56,168.57,1.01,in movies.
P094,169.78,171.02,1.24,Hyperloop films.
P112,174.16,175.47,1.31,I'd agree with the police one.
T001,180.63,183.46,2.83,"Gina Claire, have you got any? UM in the way in on?"
P092,184.13,185.09,0.96,Uhm?
P092,185.97,195.27,9.3,"Yeah, I probably would have said monsters or fixed one, or like, yeah, evil creatures, but I'm I'm. Yeah, I'm happy to go with police."
P096,199.4,202.52,3.12,"Yeah, I would have said either police or monsters is the first one."
P096,203.56,206.41,2.85,"And in cars, probably 2nd."
P096,207.11,208.16,1.05,So auto mind.
P092,212.85,215.32,2.47,I feel like ours is probably the third one.
P094,217.4,221.52,4.12,"OK, so which would we put as the first then monsters or police?"
P092,224.97,226.64,1.67,Time please.
P094,228.35,228.8,0.45,Problem.
P092,230.52,232.53,2.01,So please monsters and cards.
P096,234.43,235.14,0.71,"Yeah, sure."
P112,235.93,236.8,0.87,"Yeah, that sounds good."
T001,237.31,239.76,2.45,"Alright, so police, monsters and then cars."
T001,241.52,245.23,3.71,"Unfortunately, it's monsters, cars and then police."
T001,247.55,257.02,9.47,"Maybe people are fans of horror movies or it's the first thing that they thought of, but no matter we've got another couple of questions. So name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."
P094,259.19,259.9,0.71,Try again.
T001,260.29,261.46,1.17,"Violin is one of them, yeah."
P096,260.69,263.54,2.85,"Yeah, violent. That's the first thing I thought of as well."
P092,263.82,264.61,0.79,"Yes, I'm."
P092,266.26,266.82,0.56,Flu.
P112,266.4,267.21,0.81,Ocello
T001,268.07,269.77,1.7,Cello yes flute no.
P112,268.51,269.16,0.65,sorry.
T001,271.38,272.39,1.01,Cello yester
T001,275.51,276.83,1.32,it's a violin and cello.
P096,284.51,286.77,2.26,Would people say Chuba? Maybe I'm not sure.
T001,287.5,291.37,3.87,"A Chuba isn't there, but good to get out of the stringed instruments."
P092,292.79,293.3,0.51,And.
P092,296.9,297.75,0.85,And open.
T001,299.52,300.68,1.16,Not a noob. Oh no.
P094,303.62,304.27,0.65,Clarinet
P112,303.82,304.73,0.91,Add face.
P096,303.88,304.63,0.75,Soon.
T001,306.1,307.73,1.63,Not the bass and not the clarinet.
T001,309.17,310.21,1.04,Tinka
T001,311.59,313.37,1.78,"you know, think what's normally at the back?"
P094,316.19,317.17,0.98,click percussion.
P096,316.51,317.28,0.77,Precaution.
T001,318.08,319.61,1.53,"Yeah, so think along those lines."
P094,321.15,321.81,0.66,Tympany
P096,322.1,323.03,0.93,Symbols.
T001,324.22,327.85,3.63,"Tympany, I've actually gotta give 'cause I believe another name for the timpani is the drum."
T001,328.79,331.44,2.65,"So just drums in general, yeah."
T001,333.02,335.95,2.93,"Uhm, so we had violin, cello and drum."
T001,338.84,341.68,2.84,So we're going to rank them from the most popular to least popular now.
P092,343.49,345.28,1.79,Violin would be the most popular.
P096,346.39,346.85,0.46,Miller
P094,348.53,352.0,3.47,Is this the most popular is in how many people say it? Or how many people?
T001,351.47,355.02,3.55,So if we ask if we asked 100 people to name an instrument.
P094,353.78,354.75,0.97,"OK, I see."
P094,358.07,360.0,1.93,You definitely violated the 1st.
P112,361.22,363.43,2.21,I think John will be seconds maybe.
P096,361.72,361.97,0.25,I.
P096,368.41,372.88,4.47,"I think because it took us longer to get drone drone might be paired, but."
P094,372.91,373.3,0.39,Who?
P096,373.93,374.5,0.57,I'm not sure.
T001,378.87,383.66,4.79,"So we're pretty set on violin being first, but it's cello and drums. That's a bit of a debate."
P094,387.2,392.89,5.69,I feel like it's not the first thing that comes to my mind anyway. When I think of an orchestra as like drum specifically.
P092,394.05,394.68,0.63,Neither.
P112,394.22,399.95,5.73,"Yeah, I'm happy to go with cello then. Second, 'cause yeah, you're right. We did take us a lot longer to get drunk."
T001,403.28,405.31,2.03,"OK, so we're all in agreement then that it's."
T001,405.93,408.1,2.17,"Going to be violin, cello and lendrum."
P092,408.7,409.15,0.45,Yep.
T001,410.22,414.89,4.67,"Which is good? 'cause that's correct. The order is violin cello in drum, so we're one for two."
T001,415.9,427.45,11.55,"Let's see if we can get a 2 foot tree. So question three is name a public place or you're likely to catch a cold or flu with the note that this was pre pandemic, so the answer isn't everywhere."
P092,428.16,428.79,0.63,Uhm?
P092,429.94,430.68,0.74,Hospitals.
P096,430.09,430.48,0.39,Both.
T001,431.08,432.28,1.2,"Hospital is one of them, yeah."
P094,433.72,434.13,0.41,Well.
P096,434.07,434.4,0.33,It's.
T001,435.14,436.11,0.97,"Sorry, I mean."
P094,436.07,436.47,0.4,Cool.
T001,436.91,438.3,1.39,"School, Yep, schools, another one."
P096,440.5,443.35,2.85,Is public transport one or like a bus or something?
T001,443.63,446.26,2.63,Tank like public transport.
P092,448.42,449.03,0.61,Plane.
P096,448.92,449.81,0.89,Airport.
T001,449.84,455.41,5.57,"Plane, yeah, a plane is another one. I suppose. An airport by extension, but a plane specifically, yeah."
P096,451.31,451.6,0.29,No.
T001,457.49,461.36,3.87,So I think you know what to do at this stage. Most popular to least popular.
P092,467.94,469.47,1.53,So what was the second one again?
P112,468.52,483.13,14.61,I feel like hospital would be first baby.
P092,470.23,470.82,0.59,That we.
T001,471.7,476.3,4.6,I think in the order you gave it to me it was hospital school and then play.
P092,471.71,472.21,0.5,Decided.
P096,488.67,489.62,0.95,Probably yeah.
P096,495.64,496.92,1.28,And then maybe school.
P092,497.58,498.15,0.57,Yeah.
P096,497.88,501.45,3.57,The people are thinking about the flu and stuff like that. I'm not sure if they were taking like.
P096,502.02,508.44,6.42,"If they had a particular disease in mind, but when I think of the flu, I think of like it being spread in schools and stuff."
P092,513.35,516.78,3.43,"Yeah, sounds good to me. Hospital school than playing."
P112,518.04,519.24,1.2,See the airport.
P094,518.11,519.1,0.99,I'm not certain I.
P112,520.17,525.54,5.37,"Yeah, so you see, the plane would have much more people from backgrounds that they otherwise wouldn't see each other at."
P112,526.15,530.61,4.46,"So that's why I put it bit higher up. Maybe hospital plane school, but I'm not sure."
P094,531.24,534.04,2.8,I'm I'm actually not certain that I put hospital first.
P094,534.67,538.21,3.54,"Just out of a place that look immediately, I would think of his life."
P094,539.17,540.86,1.69,Catching something as opposed to.
P094,541.57,545.5,3.93,"Like catching like a cold or flu specifically, but maybe that's just."
P094,546.85,548.38,1.53,I don't know if you guys think otherwise.
P096,552.67,556.04,3.37,"Wasn't the first thing that came to my mind either, actually uhm?"
P096,556.96,562.91,5.95,"But thinking about it now, I think other people would put it first. I'm not sure it's hard to know."
T001,568.02,569.16,1.14,So we're divided on everything.
P096,570.52,571.9,1.38,"Yeah, it's pretty much."
P092,579.95,588.9,8.95,"Uhm, yeah. Hospital was the first thing that came to my mind just purely 'cause of like you know, when you hear if there's viruses and stuff going around like what's it like anymore?"
P092,590.17,606.36,16.19,"I'm I'm I can't remember what it's called, but uhm, I can see why people would associate hospitals more with like getting better rather than getting sick so and we could maybe put like school first. I guess I don't know but then also pre code but I guess people traveled a lot more so."
P092,607.38,608.3,0.92,Planes
P092,609.04,610.23,1.19,makes sense too.
P096,613.96,617.69,3.73,"Yeah, you're right. It's kind of hard to remember what things were like before the pandemic."
P096,618.36,621.75,3.39,It is like how people viewed travel and.
P096,626.42,629.15,2.73,Maybe school plane hospital.
P112,632.2,633.41,1.21,"I'm happy with that one, yeah?"
P092,634.71,635.15,0.44,Poop.
P094,634.83,637.82,2.99,"Yeah, I think they're all pretty equivalent here right now, is there?"
T001,638.84,642.01,3.17,So school play in hospital is the order we're going to go with.
P094,638.87,639.29,0.42,Yeah.
P092,643.38,643.87,0.49,****.
T001,644.86,647.71,2.85,"It's school, hospital plane unfortunately."
T001,649.39,655.68,6.29,"I suppose people were going into hospitals, maybe more than they were going on an airplane, just that came to mind a lot more, but."
T001,656.49,659.34,2.85,No worry at school is first and we've gotten that one at least.
T001,660.38,665.35,4.97,So a fourth question is named something you do not learn in school.
P092,670.43,672.11,1.68,How did you talk since?
P096,672.27,675.14,2.87,"I was going to say exactly the same thing. Yeah, I had to do taxes."
T001,675.59,680.12,4.53,"Think along those lines. It's not there, but think along those lines."
P112,681.27,683.54,2.27,Maybe taking out a mortgage or something like that.
T001,684.65,690.3,5.65,"No, not there either. To maybe think come away from finance. But still in that sort of."
T001,691.49,693.76,2.27,Like personal responsibility sphere.
P096,694.6,695.63,1.03,Life skills.
T001,696.75,699.76,3.01,I may be a bit more specific than that.
P096,700.88,701.59,0.71,Anne.
P092,704.21,705.27,1.06,Paying bills.
T001,706.27,710.43,4.16,"No, still like it's related to paying bills, one of them, but."
P094,711.7,712.42,0.72,Budgeting.
T001,713.01,717.7,4.69,Not budgeting again. Move away from finance. You know what's what's something that you have to do.
T001,718.79,722.08,3.29,"Now that you didn't have to do as much as a as a child, for example."
T001,728.84,730.19,1.35,"You know, in the day today."
P112,734.72,735.55,0.83,Budgeting.
T001,736.25,737.69,1.44,"No, not budgeting."
P096,743.16,747.13,3.97,"Something to do with communication, like phone calls or emails."
T001,743.23,743.74,0.51,"You know, if."
T001,745.72,751.53,5.81,"Well, that's one of them actually, something something related to communication is one of them, like one of the other ones."
T001,753.88,755.11,1.23,Just thinking on this line that.
T001,755.74,756.9,1.16,"You've been chasing, you know?"
T001,758.31,762.83,4.52,Think about things you do now. Like you know the cook clean shop.
P092,764.69,766.52,1.83,"Chores, groceries order."
T001,765.98,773.8,7.82,"Chores yeah, you know choice things that things that keep your day to day living. So yeah chores is one of them."

T001,788.2,795.14,6.94,One of them and it's kind of related to the email one you know might make you more eligible for a job.
T001,796.26,798.69,2.43,I'll say that you know if people don't have.
T001,799.43,802.4,2.97,"If people don't have this skill, it's really, really noticeable."

P094,858.45,864.32,5.87,"You said that the last one is. There isn't a manner is one that's related to emailing, or is there another one that's related to email and."
T001,865.31,869.66,4.35,"Uh, there's not another one that's really emailing so minors with the email one."

T001,891.28,896.09,4.81,"So we had household chores, manners, and parenting."
T001,897.69,899.04,1.35,So what's going to be the ordering?
P092,902.57,908.32,5.75,Here was the like survey conducted on can I ask that you don't like?
T001,907.99,910.72,2.73,"Other than other than 100 people, I don't know."

P096,925.04,931.65,6.61,"Again, it kinda took us a long time. Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you. I was just saying it took us a long time to get some of those so."
P094,925.13,925.58,0.45,I think.
P096,932.33,933.7,1.37,It might just be us.
P096,934.77,940.58,5.81,"And like our demographic thinking of things differently, I'm not sure how other people would number those."
P096,941.29,941.9,0.61,Uhm?
P096,943.2,944.73,1.53,"But yeah, well, just what do people think?"
P094,943.44,943.86,0.42,Trip.
P094,945.21,949.4,4.19,I do think like we were like had this. Just heard a lot of them like.
P094,950.92,952.27,1.35,I've just the general like.
P094,953.24,958.47,5.23,Life skills and communication skills. Even if we didn't have the specific words.
P092,960.25,960.82,0.57,Yeah.
P094,961.49,964.88,3.39,"Parenting is 1, but like only for a specific demographic."
P094,968.36,969.76,1.4,But it isn't echo in this house.
P092,970.7,976.85,6.15,"Yeah, I could see lots of people like answering it in kind of a joking manner. Like oh parenting haha."
P092,977.59,978.4,0.81,Uhm?
T001,980.56,984.99,4.43,"Yes, you could almost see if somebody had kids stick because, well, I really wish they taught me that in school, but."
P096,986.88,988.08,1.2,"Yeah, I agree."
P092,989.79,990.56,0.77,Adam.
P092,991.37,997.15,5.78,"I think pressing I'd probably go chores, parenting than manners, but I don't know about you guys."

P096,1010.06,1010.47,0.41,Yep.
T001,1015.35,1017.56,2.21,It's actually parenting matters and chores.
T001,1019.5,1021.42,1.92,So maybe it's slightly different demographic.
T001,1025.2,1030.15,4.95,"No matter well, we got one of four and you know it's actually not bad."
T001,1031.99,1033.37,1.38,Thanks very much for playing.
