'cause I'm going to explain it anyway."
T002,20.28,29.63,9.35,So I'm gonna ask you guys a question which was also asked 100 people in the survey and you have to guess the most popular answers for the survey. So the top 3 answers.
T002,30.43,49.64,19.21,"And then afterwards, once you have the top 3 answers, I get off speech like rank them in order of popularity. So for example, if I asked you name something people are afraid of, you might come up with spiders heights and other people and this kind of spiders would be the most popular then heights and then other people."
T002,50.8,57.42,6.62,"And remember, it's not necessarily the most like correct answer, but just I guess the word that people said the most."
T002,58.57,66.86,8.29,"Uhm, I give you guys a hint of you're stuck and you're not like competing in this scenario. You're working together. You can shout things out and just goes to each other or whatever."

P127,95.57,96.24,0.67,A zombie.
T002,96.59,109.14,12.55,"Zombie that's close. That's kind of in the right genre to try and figure like a broader term for something like a zombie ghost and zombie, try and take it like a broader chair that could describe maybe all of those."
P154,102.2,102.93,0.73,Goes.

P141,121.4,121.78,0.38,Next
T002,122.35,125.06,2.71,"So monsters, there's two more things."
P141,125.17,131.34,6.17,"so we did the oil type movies, so we need to think about other type of movies. I think as well. So like."
T002,130.82,131.35,0.53,Yeah.
P141,132.18,133.79,1.61,Call yeah carrots.

T002,141.13,142.92,1.79,"No, animals isn't on there really."
P141,144.4,148.94,4.54,"Maybe people were already thinking it's monsters already, so you know it got."

T002,160.78,170.41,9.63,"Remember that already have to be logically separated, either 'cause these are just random people on the street, like guessing things they're not going to throw them into categories categories necessarily."
P141,164.48,165.09,0.61,Yeah.
P154,174.88,176.12,1.24,Faced by police.
T002,176.57,178.35,1.78,"Yeah please, that's the third one."
P154,177.63,178.08,0.45,Oh yeah.
P141,178.27,178.73,0.46,Yeah.
T002,179.88,192.67,12.79,"They actually said cops because I think it was an American survey, but whatever cops police, same thing. So we had monsters, cars and cops know what order would you arrange these in in terms of popularity?"
P154,180.42,180.77,0.35,The.
P154,183.65,184.32,0.67,Black Ops
P141,184.42,184.77,0.35,Yeah.

P141,202.93,208.78,5.85,So is it something we should agree on and tell you or is it like we throw and all?
T002,208.15,216.1,7.95,"You throw things out, and if anyone disagrees with the order, just say and you argue your case, whatever. So come to some sort of consensus."
P141,211.11,211.68,0.57,OK.
P127,212.78,213.36,0.58,OK.
P141,214.45,215.08,0.63,OK.
P141,216.13,222.44,6.31,"So so busy it's first, but I would go with car on my side after because it's more broad than cops."
P141,223.39,225.95,2.56,But logic sometimes is.
T002,223.4,223.93,0.53,Yeah.
P154,223.94,224.27,0.33,It.
P147,224.17,224.68,0.51,I agree.

T002,236.88,239.67,2.79,"Yeah, I guess that's the order you guys thought of them in."
P127,239.55,240.04,0.49,Yeah.

T002,243.61,245.96,2.35,"Yeah, anyone wanna switch those render you good?"

T002,322.7,334.14,11.44,"Right, so we have violin, cello and drums. Goodwill, weird selection, dispose of two string instruments. I don't know. Uh, what would you order these in there or something comes top?"
P141,333.33,335.4,2.07,I actually would keep the order on my sides.
T002,336.47,337.64,1.17,"Violin cello, drums."

T002,345.51,348.49,2.98,"OK, what do you? What do you guys think about that?"
P141,346.88,347.22,0.34,like.
P141,348.92,350.91,1.99,So why do you think dreams of Ichiro?
P147,352.25,357.09,4.84,"I feel like shadow is not common instrument to think of, whereas problems if you just kind of guessing, you kind of say."
P154,357.58,364.03,6.45,"Yeah, it's drums and widen or like 2. Most common cello is like I don't think so yeah. So I think yeah."
P141,357.6,358.25,0.65,Yeah.
P127,361.43,362.28,0.85,There must come.
P141,365.15,373.04,7.89,"That the way I was thinking is white shadow came. It's because I suspect a lot of people know strings, so they would say very Northshore alternatively."
P141,374.91,384.12,9.21,"But but actually drums, you may be writing it. So yeah, yeah, let's I mean, OK. I agree with James, and I would switch my order."
P154,374.91,376.26,1.35,"Yeah, that's also a point."
T002,374.96,375.49,0.53,Me.

P154,398.18,399.74,1.56,"So Thomas was thinking, right?"
T002,402.56,411.63,9.07,"Yeah, I feel like that's a weird one altogether. Like it's not such a broad representation of the Symphony Orchestra, but I guess it doesn't have to be. It's just what people said."
P154,410.84,411.81,0.97,I think people will.
P141,411.09,411.79,0.7,The way it is.
P141,412.7,414.68,1.98,"Yeah look, it's good now go."
P154,412.82,413.32,0.5,Sorry.
P154,414.13,421.76,7.63,"No, I was just saying people were like maybe string strings and then they were like what else is there? Oh drums and I think that's what."
P127,414.54,414.98,0.44,Yeah.
P141,420.42,420.91,0.49,Man.

T002,447.46,458.08,10.62,"OK, so I'm just going to point out before you start guessing that this question was asked before the whole pandemic situation, so maybe bear that in mind when you're trying to think and stuff."
T002,459.05,463.84,4.79,The question is name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu bug.
P141,465.19,465.78,0.59,My head.
P147,467.39,468.62,1.23,"A gig, a concert."
T002,469.54,474.45,4.91,"The concert is not there. I feel like that's a very COVID themed answer. For now, let's go to concerts anyway."

T002,517.39,525.44,8.05,"Yeah, I wouldn't think of that off the top of my head, but maybe that's just COVID brain since I've been stuck in the same country for two years that we've been on a plane at all."
T002,526.1,533.73,7.63,"Right, so we had a hospital, school and airplane there. The three choices, what we're doing what?"
P141,532.99,537.9,4.91,"I think played is the last one. I don't see plane being the first one, so."

P141,546.89,547.3,0.41,Then
T002,548.16,548.63,0.47,Yeah.
T002,550.0,554.05,4.05,"Hospital hospital affairs plane loss, which leaves school 2nd."

P154,559.45,559.74,0.29,If.
P141,560.78,569.87,9.09,"Like I'm kind of thinking schools might be first because if you have a lot of parents who have been asked the question, they will definitely think schools first."

T002,873.02,879.37,6.35,I feel like this is a bit this question totally depends like on the stage in life and generation where you are maybe like.
T002,880.33,882.22,1.89,I know it's just a different kind of.
T002,883.25,884.92,1.67,Zone of people that they asked.

T002,914.04,917.22,3.18,"I don't think we didn't have anything like that, definitely."

T002,919.2,922.27,3.07,"OK, well we did. Do you think you'd put these things in?"
P127,921.76,922.97,1.21,Uh.

T002,934.4,935.28,0.88,"Yeah, has."
P141,934.56,943.88,9.32,"But I would go with parents on my side because I'm pretty sure the number of time of people say, oh, listen to your parents. You're gonna see that later or something like that."
P147,945.26,947.26,2.0,That's not the same as learning parents. You know what I mean?
P147,948.1,948.47,0.37,Like it's.
P141,948.1,951.07,2.97,"I would put manners, parent and housework on my side."

P154,978.61,979.02,0.41,It could.
P154,980.28,984.85,4.57,"Yeah, I think it could be like the housework could be the first one because I feel."
P154,986.3,994.61,8.31,Two out of the three choices are but selfish to the parents. If they want them to do something. So maybe I don't know. I'm just thinking it could be one.
P141,996.36,998.86,2.5,Sorry I didn't get what other were you proposing.
P154,996.57,997.08,0.51,But
P147,997.03,997.91,0.88,Quite powerful.
P127,998.67,999.98,1.31,Virginia proposed.
P154,1001.2,1016.47,15.27,"like the two options, house works and manners like these things are the responsibility of parents. But if they say to, if they ask the children to learn that in school, that's like they're thinking selfishly about themselves so."
P147,1016.01,1019.19,3.18,"Yeah, the answers will sound quite parenty answers that what you mean."
P154,1019.99,1020.48,0.49,OK.
P147,1021.1,1023.29,2.19,"So no, I agree with you. I think maybe."

P154,1036.69,1040.2,3.51,"The house works, then the manners, and then the parenting."
P154,1040.99,1041.54,0.55,Maybe?
P141,1042.25,1049.74,7.49,"Yeah no, I really think the miners are going to come first. Even if you say that's kind of selfish in some way, I think it's more global."
P154,1049.29,1052.06,2.77,"Play, it could be like up and down, but."
P127,1051.18,1051.99,0.81,In

T002,1054.86,1055.33,0.47,OK.
T002,1061.21,1072.04,10.83,"Yeah, remember the question is just name something you don't learn in school, so that's the only logic that anyone considering whether answering the question. Not like the best thing she made in school or."
P147,1072.69,1074.16,1.47,"Yeah, I think mine is number once though."
P154,1073.94,1075.51,1.57,"Man, it's OK we can go with that."
