T001,8.48,21.95,13.47,"So hello everyone and thanks for coming today. We're going to play a quiz, so I'm going to ask you a question and you're going to need to give me the tree most popular answers to that question. The question was posed to 100 people."
T001,22.93,28.1,5.17,"After you get the tree top answers, I'm going to ask you to rank them from most popular to least popular."
T001,29.06,33.73,4.67,And that's the entire quiz. So do you have any questions on this before we start?
T001,36.95,43.27,6.32,"Brilliance OK, so the first question is name something people are often chased by in movies."
P013,46.45,47.12,0.67,Police
T001,48.15,51.32,3.17,"At least you know police are cops is one of them, yeah."

P041,58.49,59.06,0.57,Ours.
P031,58.66,59.27,0.61,Birthday.
T001,59.95,65.34,5.39,"Cars would be another one, yet, so we've got police in cars and we've got one more."
P031,66.12,69.57,3.45,I was going to say cars so I.
T001,69.21,70.83,1.62,Unfortunately beaten to it.
P031,72.22,72.98,0.76,Uhm?
P031,74.77,75.61,0.84,I'm not sure.
P031,76.34,77.09,0.75,Anne.
P031,79.65,80.81,1.16,Maybe zombies?
T001,81.93,90.3,8.37,"Zombies, yeah, I'll take that. It's it's monsters in general. I think I think nowadays maybe more zombies are the most popular one, but monsters?"
P031,85.21,85.62,0.41,OK.
T001,91.23,101.17,9.94,"Uhm, OK, so we've got. We've got police or cops cars and monsters, so now I'm going to ask you to sort of work together as a team and try and."
T001,101.85,104.72,2.87,Rank them from most popular to least popular.
T001,106.48,108.27,1.79,So what do you think is gonna be the most popular and then?
P041,112.78,117.33,4.55,Maybe the monsters that sounds like something people would say zombies and monsters. It seemed like a good one.
P013,117.83,118.48,0.65,Diagram.
P031,119.01,122.04,3.03,"It's like collective group, so yeah."
P041,119.02,119.43,0.41,Yeah.
P041,121.49,121.88,0.39,Yeah.
P031,122.66,123.33,0.67,I'd say so.
P041,125.13,125.88,0.75,And then.
P031,126.61,127.79,1.18,Maybe after that?
P031,129.19,129.95,0.76,Uhm?
P013,130.8,134.15,3.35,Pangit book off second hand cars third.
P041,134.48,134.92,0.44,Yeah.
P031,134.82,139.64,4.82,"Yeah, 'cause the cars cars like a car chase like there could be like I don't know."
P013,139.41,140.0,0.59,Yeah.
P041,140.31,140.68,0.37,Yeah.
T001,142.08,146.45,4.37,"OK, so it seems like you all have agreement on that, but just to be sure you're saying it's monsters."
T001,147.23,148.53,1.3,Cops and then cars.
P031,149.18,149.71,0.53,Yeah.
T001,150.75,172.64,21.89,"OK, so I regret to inform you that you're not right on this one. Monsters is first sponsors. First, you're absolutely right there. But cars and cops are swapped over so it's cars 1st and then cops. I suppose the reasoning is that cops drive cars, but other people drive cars as well, so but that's OK, we've got another two questions and."
T001,173.49,178.56,5.07,So the next one is going to be named an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra.
P041,182.58,183.42,0.84,Violin.
T001,184.33,186.08,1.75,"Yep, violin is one of them."
P031,192.29,193.14,0.85,Cello
T001,193.69,194.96,1.27,Cello will be another one yet.
P013,198.61,201.12,2.51,And double vision.
T001,198.95,199.42,0.47,Rip
T001,201.97,204.96,2.99,"we're really focusing on the strings. Double bass is not one of them, but."
P013,204.89,206.43,1.54,Lincoln Trumpet maybe?
T001,207.52,213.58,6.06,"Not a trumpet, no? UM, it's good that you're branching out into the other sections of the orchestra, though."
P013,213.21,214.03,0.82,Mr.
P041,213.96,214.63,0.67,Flute
T001,215.26,217.69,2.43,Flute no dumb.
T001,220.03,221.3,1.27,Not a flu shot or flu.
P013,222.6,223.69,1.09,Can you give us a clue?
T001,225.15,229.94,4.79,"Uh, I'm going to say that it's not in the woodwind or brass section so you know."
T001,231.0,233.13,2.13,What else would you have in an orchestra?
P013,233.54,234.62,1.08,Drones.
T001,235.42,242.77,7.35,"That's the one. Yeah, it's a drums. A nice bit of percussion, so we had violin. We had cello and we had drums."
T001,243.87,247.08,3.21,So now we're going to rank them from most popular to least popular.
P031,249.33,256.24,6.91,"And I would have thought of violin. First off though, like I was going to say that one too. So I've played that."
P031,257.55,262.96,5.41,"But in fact, that's when when you hear something works transite violin, but I'm not sure about the other team."
T001,263.86,264.55,0.69,OK.
P041,265.93,267.66,1.73,Shallow then maybe drums.
P013,268.54,270.3,1.76,It took us so long to get close.
P041,270.08,270.44,0.36,Yeah.
P041,271.98,273.01,1.03,Person you think?
T001,272.63,280.87,8.24,"Yeah, considering considering you got violent and cello right off the bat and took a while to get drums. Seems like a good reason. So you're saying violin cello and then drum."
P031,281.67,283.14,1.47,"Yeah, yeah."
P013,282.14,282.81,0.67,Yeah.
T001,284.23,287.02,2.79,"Well, that's correct. You're right in that one."
P013,287.2,287.58,0.38,Nice.
T001,289.89,293.24,3.35,So that's one that's one out of two. Let's see if we can make a 2 for tree.
T001,293.95,294.68,0.73,And then.
T001,295.75,305.22,9.47,"We've got a good score here, so name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu. And I'm going to say that this was asked before the pandemic."
T001,307.54,312.09,4.55,"So that's that's if it was passed after the pandemic, that it might be a bit skewed, but."
P041,307.74,308.09,0.35,I'm.
P031,309.59,310.3,0.71,Everett
P031,312.77,313.28,0.51,yeah.
P041,313.38,316.06,2.68,"Well, a bar is, I would say."
T001,316.82,321.46,4.64,"Bar isn't there, although that is a good answer. It's not in not in the top tree though."
P041,319.0,319.34,0.34,Oh
P031,321.93,328.84,6.91,"Oh, is that 'cause it's public place like, will that be considered private? And like would it be like a park maybe?"
T001,329.99,332.54,2.55,A not a park park isn't one of them.
P013,333.46,336.57,3.11,Try to think back to like before it was everywhere.
T001,338.24,344.19,5.95,"Back to the before times swimming pool, no, not a swimming pool. Think, think places where you know."
P013,338.27,339.22,0.95,I guess women do.
P041,343.39,344.11,0.72,Public toilets
P013,344.59,345.4,0.81,A hospital.
T001,345.99,348.46,2.47,Hospital is one of them. I didn't hear what David said.
P013,348.87,349.2,0.33,Sorry.
P041,349.11,350.28,1.17,public points.
T001,350.9,355.63,4.73,"No, no hospital is one of them. Hospital is one of them."
T001,357.16,359.71,2.55,Think of places where there's like a high concentration of people.
P031,360.25,362.0,1.75,Like a playground maybe?
T001,363.12,364.72,1.6,Along similar lines maybe?
P041,366.22,367.31,1.09,Music concert
T001,368.75,370.42,1.67,"No, that's another good one."
P041,369.34,369.52,0.18,Yep.
T001,371.28,372.29,1.01,Sorry sorry man.
P013,371.98,372.99,1.01,He's been back.
T001,373.6,378.81,5.21,"No, not a theme park. Take along the lines of playground but like where else might you find children?"
P013,381.86,382.41,0.55,Screw.
P041,382.74,383.43,0.69,Scoop.
T001,382.95,389.82,6.87,"At school, yeah, that's cool. Yeah so school and hospital is one of them. Are two of them. We've got one more."
T001,391.0,393.89,2.89,"And you might kick yourselves after you find it, because it's."
P041,398.65,400.27,1.62,Public places like.
T001,401.07,402.82,1.75,This one I'm gonna say.
P041,402.2,403.73,1.53,How much is zooms?
T001,404.48,406.86,2.38,"This one is a bit of an odd public place, but uhm."
P031,407.79,408.02,0.23,Right?
P041,407.83,408.5,0.67,Uhm?
P013,408.6,409.27,0.67,Peach
T001,409.66,412.26,2.6,Not the beach. Think more like come.
T001,414.92,416.49,1.57,Think more like come.
T001,417.23,418.72,1.49,A vehicle of some kind.
P031,419.16,419.9,0.74,Bus.
P013,419.74,420.14,0.4,this.
T001,420.56,422.89,2.33,Not a boss getting close though.
P041,421.7,423.41,1.71,Stramer frame.
P013,422.4,423.27,0.87,Greetings.
T001,425.63,426.62,0.99,"What it be, let's say?"
P041,426.84,428.28,1.44,That rhyme or a train?
T001,429.73,431.32,1.59,"Not a tram or train, no."
P013,431.61,432.34,0.73,The plane.
T001,432.59,434.3,1.71,"A plane, yes, an airplane."
T001,436.68,437.98,1.3,All that recycled air.
T001,439.98,443.92,3.94,"I question whether an airplane is a public place, but that's not. That's not up for debate here."
T001,445.49,451.46,5.97,"OK, so we had hospital school and an airplane, so now we're going to rank them and we're going to see."
T001,452.46,454.52,2.06,Why do people think it's the most infectious place?
P031,456.05,458.26,2.21,The hospital maybe?
P041,458.99,460.54,1.55,I would say school but.
P013,459.64,460.69,1.05,I'm not scared.
P031,462.0,462.45,0.45,OK.
P013,464.0,465.17,1.17,Just 'cause of the kids?
P013,466.16,468.3,2.14,Collective always got something going on.
P031,469.04,476.66,7.62,"Yeah, I think it's just like when you hear infectious. I'd think hospital 'cause like that's where people go and they're sick so it's like a group of people."
P013,477.44,478.55,1.11,Fair actually.
P031,478.96,480.43,1.47,For I don't know.
P013,481.0,482.36,1.36,Like we're in association.
P031,482.92,483.52,0.6,Yeah.
P013,485.13,486.13,1.0,"Yeah, maybe actually."
P041,486.3,488.32,2.02,"Maybe school, hospital and."
P031,489.34,490.58,1.24,"Yeah, then plane."
P013,490.47,491.96,1.49,"Yeah, I agree."
P031,492.08,492.45,0.37,That
T001,493.1,497.51,4.41,"OK, so it seems we have a bit of consensus here. Going to school hospital and then airplane."
P013,499.18,500.16,0.98,He looks like it's wrong.
T001,501.78,505.94,4.16,"Well, it's it's right, so I wanted to give you a bit of false impression there."
P031,503.69,504.2,0.51,hello.
T001,507.72,513.08,5.36,"No, that's right at school, hospital and then airplane. So that's that's another one, correct? That's two for tree, which is very good."
T001,514.16,519.87,5.71,Very good guys and you almost said #1 correct? So I'm just going to say thank you for playing you did great.
P013,520.74,521.27,0.53,Great game.
P031,522.03,522.57,0.54,Ominous.
