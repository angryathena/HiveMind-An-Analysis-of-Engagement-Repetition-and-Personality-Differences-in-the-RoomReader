T001,21.93,23.19,1.26,Not dog stuff.
P048,22.78,24.48,1.7,I'd say zombies.
T001,25.38,31.56,6.18,"Something a little bit more broad than zombies, maybe a little bit more broad than birders like. Is there anything that?"

P040,56.53,58.8,2.27,Saying animals be too broad or.
T001,59.29,66.14,6.85,"Animals would be too broad, but also move closer to sort of people."
P052,66.96,67.91,0.95,Ghosts.
T001,68.92,72.85,3.93,"It goes, I think ghosts would be classic monsters so."
P044,73.28,75.26,1.98,Please like security is in description.
T001,74.46,76.29,1.83,Police Yep police is 1.

T001,95.66,96.49,0.83,One other thing.
P040,98.01,101.79,3.78,"Yeah, it's like every movie I've ever watched is popped into my head now, so I can't think of anything."
P048,101.72,105.41,3.69,"Feels like like car chasing, but then you would also have to be in a farm."
T001,105.3,106.91,1.61,Car Jason yeah.

P048,110.08,110.63,0.55,"well, good."
T001,112.02,112.59,0.57,So.
T001,113.73,123.43,9.7,"We had monsters. We had cops and we had cars, so those are the top 3 answers and I'm going to ask you now to rank them from most popular to least popular."
P040,125.29,127.2,1.91,I would say cars would be most popular.
P048,129.34,134.99,5.65,"I think if it is a category, I would assume that it's like the most popular 'cause it feels like."
P040,134.02,134.53,0.51,Yeah.
P048,136.81,138.26,1.45,So many movies have fun.
P044,136.82,143.19,6.37,"These are 100 answers. This is hunt people answered and rank them that way, right more so than the actual categories."
T001,144.01,146.5,2.49,"Yeah, like uh, yes. GO 100 people and this is."
T001,147.23,148.55,1.32,The most popular they chose.
P044,148.68,149.09,0.41,OK.
P048,149.06,149.47,0.41,Or
P040,150.77,157.69,6.92,"Galaxy Cars just because they could fit a lot more movies, monsters who are very specific thing for very specific genre movies."
P040,158.35,162.9,4.55,So I don't know if he's agreed. I'd say cars cops.
P048,159.45,159.96,0.51,yeah.
P048,161.46,163.58,2.12,I've agreed I try it out.

P040,165.58,165.93,0.35,No.
P048,165.6,168.49,2.89,And what do we think then? Cops or monsters?
P040,171.29,172.66,1.37,Whitesnake up second.
P044,171.39,171.82,0.43,Comes up.
P044,172.9,173.24,0.34,Yeah.
P048,173.61,181.88,8.27,"I would say cops are second, but then wouldn't a lot of people's minds monsters pop in earlier? Like with us we thought of or first?"
P052,173.85,174.26,0.41,Yeah.
P044,181.78,182.41,0.63,This is true.
P040,182.16,183.46,1.3,A month with a very specific.
P044,185.22,191.13,5.91,"But if everyone else is answering, if it's ever notes, just ranking person as well, I can see why are you saying that like it's?"
P048,185.23,185.66,0.43,Alright.
P040,185.3,185.96,0.66,Play florin
P040,190.61,190.87,0.26,yeah.
P048,191.19,192.28,1.09,"True, true."
P048,194.22,196.07,1.85,"Alright, so I think we're decided then."
P040,194.36,197.11,2.75,I know it either or I don't mind.
T001,196.72,198.98,2.26,"Yeah, can I push you for an answer? It's a."

T001,203.81,204.98,1.17,"Cars, monsters and police."
T001,205.87,215.69,9.82,"OK, unfortunately not the ranking. No, not the correct ranking. It goes monsters first cars and then cops so."
P052,214.93,216.01,1.08,Poo poo
P048,215.01,215.86,0.85,Oh ****.
T001,216.77,223.6,6.83,"Cars is quite popular, but uhm, I think people think movie they think monster movie immediately off the top of their head."
T001,224.38,234.97,10.59,"But no worries, we've got two more, so hopefully we can go to for tree. I actually, we've got several more. Name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra."
P040,237.48,238.05,0.57,Violin.
T001,238.64,239.81,1.17,"Violin is one of them, yeah."

P052,261.09,261.9,0.81,piano.
T001,263.11,263.75,0.64,No.
P048,264.56,267.23,2.67,"Sorry, what was the category, I froze for a bit so I won't."
T001,267.75,274.79,7.04,"Name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra and we've already had violin and cello, so we've got one more defined."
P044,275.73,277.87,2.14,"Trumpets, is there something in the brass?"
T001,278.73,280.21,1.48,"No, not trumpets."
T001,286.84,288.21,1.37,I'm going to say that it's a.
T001,289.44,292.09,2.65,"Even though it's the third most popular answer, it's a little bit."
T001,292.91,297.4,4.49,You know a little bit underutilized in our Symphony Orchestra is not the first one you think of.
P040,297.02,297.95,0.93,The triangle.
T001,298.83,299.58,0.75,Close.
T001,300.7,301.55,0.85,Getting closer.

P048,309.37,311.17,1.8,A A bass double bass.
T001,311.68,313.37,1.69,"No, not a double bass, no?"
P048,314.23,315.72,1.49,Conversions affect.
T001,314.25,319.2,4.95,I'm going to say where does a triangle live in the Symphony Orchestra?
P040,318.25,319.38,1.13,At least.
P044,318.98,320.15,1.17,It's account is percussion.
P052,319.99,321.07,1.08,Percussion.
P040,321.07,321.44,0.37,Uh.

P044,327.25,327.54,0.29,Oh
T001,329.93,335.78,5.85,"Uhm, 2 string instruments and then apparently drum was the third well."
P052,336.04,336.55,0.51,OK.
T001,337.36,338.69,1.33,The last remaining one.
T001,339.78,342.89,3.11,"Uhm, OK, so we're going to ask you to rank them there."
P044,344.51,345.26,0.75,coming by the.
P044,346.15,349.24,3.09,How long does it take to say it? I think drums is probably going to be third.
P040,349.83,354.78,4.95,"Yeah, I would agree. I would say Violet will be first to be honest with you and then come."
P048,351.3,351.91,0.61,Yeah.
P044,352.72,352.97,0.25,Yeah.
P044,353.65,353.93,0.28,Yeah.

T001,359.11,363.43,4.32,"Yeah, OK, I think that's a good. That's a good way of going about it because."
T001,364.15,371.56,7.41,You know you got violin and cello straight away and then dropped a little bit longer and I'm glad to say that that's the correct ordering.
P040,371.95,372.48,0.53,Who?
T001,372.87,375.96,3.09,"It's it's violin, cello and then drums."
T001,378.22,389.91,11.69,"So our third question is going to be name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu, and I'm going to preface this one by saying this questionnaire was given before the pandemic."
P040,392.27,392.81,0.54,And.
T001,392.34,392.92,0.58,So.
P044,392.59,393.68,1.09,As opposed to everywhere.
T001,393.89,399.54,5.65,"Yeah, so the answer is not everywhere, it's it's. It's really specific places that people have."
P040,394.18,396.05,1.87,Would public transport?
P040,401.87,404.22,2.35,With public transport being or is that too broad?
T001,405.27,408.2,2.93,Public transport think along the lines of public transport.
P040,409.46,410.08,0.62,Buses

T001,468.73,475.21,6.48,"No, think of think of things that are in the news quite a lot actually. Even these days I said it was before the pandemic, but."
T001,486.45,491.29,4.84,Or think about maybe the time that you're likely to catch a cold nearly every year without fail.
P040,500.43,505.44,5.01,I know you're saying so. It's yeah somewhere where people go turn the winter time and.
P048,500.59,502.85,2.26,It's like a Christmas gathering.
P040,510.8,512.33,1.53,School I don't know.
T001,511.72,514.97,3.25,"School, yeah, let's go see other schools. The other one."

T001,526.96,529.38,2.42,"Yeah, school is the last remaining one so."
T001,530.73,536.46,5.73,I believe that you got plane first hospital and then school so.
P048,536.16,536.59,0.43,Yeah.
T001,537.12,539.79,2.67,We can ask you to go from most popular to least popular again.
P040,541.22,545.07,3.85,I'd say hospital will be First off because that's just associated with sick people.
P044,541.4,541.86,0.46,Input.

P044,553.18,561.99,8.81,"Yeah, I think school is probably lost. I think I will complain over hospital because like I definitely now reduce it now, she said Charlie. I definitely remember like."
P044,563.12,566.31,3.19,Being told every single time I get off the plane for my nose.
P044,567.35,569.48,2.13,"But no, it's one or the other."
T001,569.87,571.6,1.73,All that lovely recycled air.
P044,571.68,572.47,0.79,Yeah.
P044,573.34,573.96,0.62,Uhm?
P040,574.27,582.5,8.23,"I mean, who would say hospital as fast and he would say plane's first? 'cause I'm saying ospitale Adam saying claim. So what did Charlie and?"
P048,583.44,585.19,1.75,Yeah I would say hospital first.

T001,604.73,613.62,8.89,"Again, you know, maybe in a post pandemic world, yes, but no, you know when this question was asked about school hospital and then airplane."
T001,614.4,614.82,0.42,So.
P052,614.73,616.26,1.53,School is first.
P048,616.36,616.79,0.43,no.
T001,616.72,621.53,4.81,"Yeah, maybe that question will change as a as the world opens up again."
P044,616.9,617.47,0.57,Interesting.
P048,620.93,622.32,1.39,"Yeah, and maybe it will."
T001,623.82,629.73,5.91,"So got another question. A name, something that you did not learn in school."

P044,663.97,664.32,0.35,Nope.
T001,664.84,667.91,3.07,"Although think along the lines of cooking, cooking is close to one of them."
P040,668.41,669.13,0.72,Cleaning.
T001,670.1,670.99,0.89,Getting closer.

P044,687.59,690.1,2.51,"There's something financial accounting, there's something."
T001,691.07,693.78,2.71,"No, surprisingly nothing financial."
P048,695.49,696.82,1.33,could it be sex Ed?
T001,699.12,705.05,5.93,"No, it's not. Although one of the answers is kind of in a way close to that."
P048,705.81,706.26,0.45,Huh?
T001,707.17,708.1,0.93,In a roundabout way.
P044,708.92,711.06,2.14,Relationships social.
T001,710.6,713.82,3.22,"Still kind of in a roundabout way, related to one of them."
P044,725.96,726.59,0.63,Round up.
T001,726.26,727.79,1.53,What's maybe something that they?
T001,729.73,731.12,1.39,They would teach you in sex Ed.
T001,748.32,750.34,2.02,"Like it's something they teach you, but it's kind of a."
T001,753.1,754.43,1.33,Something related to it.
P048,758.87,761.24,2.37,"Look, is it just like safety or."
P040,758.93,759.83,0.9,Relationships.

P040,802.02,802.34,0.32,Yeah.
T001,804.37,805.68,1.31,I think that's always the way though.
P048,804.56,806.55,1.99,and you said no financials.
T001,807.26,809.01,1.75,Not financials now become.
T001,809.87,811.22,1.35,Maybe what something does?
T001,812.66,818.15,5.49,"When you notice that somebody doesn't know dies, it's really really noticeable."
P040,820.9,821.67,0.77,Uh.
P048,827.19,830.28,3.09,Make history here. Geography and some places.

P044,845.01,845.48,0.47,very good.
P048,846.5,847.15,0.65,Nice.
T001,848.81,856.96,8.15,"So we had sort of household chores, responsibilities, parenting, took us awhile to get parenting, but we got there."
P048,850.69,851.56,0.87,Stop.
T001,857.97,861.1,3.13,And then manners. So I'm going to ask you to rank them.
P040,861.93,865.08,3.15,"Yeah, I mean me personally I wouldn't have any UM."
T001,862.65,863.51,0.86,Mostly soccer.
P040,866.03,867.74,1.71,Favor out of those to go first.
P052,868.57,869.31,0.74,Oh
P040,869.62,871.51,1.89,I had a hard time getting all of those so.
P040,872.87,873.38,0.51,Uh.
P048,873.2,876.38,3.18,I think maybe George I would put first just 'cause.
P040,876.68,877.43,0.75,Their general.
P048,878.18,882.95,4.77,"Yeah, they're kind of general and like if you'll lift with someone. It's painfully aware if."
P040,883.39,884.17,0.78,When they don't do.
P048,883.77,884.56,0.79,People just.
P048,885.26,887.67,2.41,"Don't know, don't never had to do it."
P040,888.77,889.28,0.51,True.
P048,889.16,891.43,2.27,And but that's just my guess.
P044,890.11,892.33,2.22,What about manners? Then I forgot.
P044,893.4,894.89,1.49,I don't know something about the pairing thing.
P048,893.46,895.1,1.64,"Yeah, maybe put manners after that."
P044,895.8,897.39,1.59,Seems like it wouldn't be as popular.
P040,895.88,897.85,1.97,"Everyone interviewed was probably a parent, so."
P044,898.71,899.19,0.48,Yeah.

P040,908.12,908.57,0.45,Please.
T001,910.48,917.94,7.46,"Unfortunately, flips the other way around, it's it's parenting matters shores. You got manners, rush? You got matters, right?"
P044,912.16,912.93,0.77,Alcatraz.
P048,913.27,913.85,0.58,No.
P052,915.44,916.03,0.59,Ah.
T001,919.6,925.68,6.08,"Uhm, you know the priority of priority matters is fine, so I think that's I think that's one."
T001,926.38,928.99,2.61,"At 4:00, but you were pretty close on a few."
T001,929.75,930.86,1.11,So like.
P040,929.91,930.89,0.98,We're not doing too good.
T001,932.6,936.31,3.71,"And that's all of our questions today, so thanks for playing."
P040,935.54,936.23,0.69,"Oh, right."
T001,937.97,939.68,1.71,"It's not a zero, it's not a 0."
