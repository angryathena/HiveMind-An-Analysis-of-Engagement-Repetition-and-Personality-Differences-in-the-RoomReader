T002,3.65,16.34,12.69,"And So what we're going to be doing today is a quiz game and you might be familiar with this from a TV show called Family Feud or Family Fights we've ever watched that. But if you haven't, don't don't worry. For when I say that anyway."
T002,17.07,25.32,8.25,So I'm going to ask you all the question on this question was previously asked to like 100 people in just a random survey.
T002,25.99,42.25,16.26,"And you have to try and guess the most popular answers given in the survey. So say I asked you name something people are afraid of. He might come up with spiders heights and other people, so they're the three most popular answers that were taken on the day."
T002,43.13,54.54,11.41,"And then afterwards I'm gonna ask you to rank the top 3 answers in order of popularity. So which do you think was the worst? Spiders was most common than heights that other people, but that clears that, alright?"
P088,55.01,55.34,0.33,Yep.
T002,55.86,64.31,8.45,"OK, and in this scenario you're not like against each other or anything. You could just shout out answers, talk to each other about what you think is best, whatever together."
T002,65.97,67.94,1.97,"OK, ready for your question one."
T002,70.64,73.81,3.17,Name something people are often chased by in movies?

T002,85.93,99.78,13.85,"Yeah, they're actually both on the list, so you got two out of three already. So yeah, I think they said costs, but basically the same thing I think was attacked. The survey was taken in America, cops and cars, or both of them. It's so well done, there's just one more now."
P088,100.8,101.21,0.41,And.

T002,110.41,111.58,1.17,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
P123,111.61,113.48,1.87,"Bank robbers, or like other people."
T002,114.5,116.21,1.71,"Uh, no, that's not on there."
T002,116.85,123.12,6.27,"I remember these aren't necessarily the most correct answers, so just what people said animals isn't on the list either."
P103,117.05,117.74,0.69,Animals.
P116,131.02,132.91,1.89,Would it be a type of animal? Can we ask that?
T002,133.88,137.96,4.08,"Oh yeah, you can ask that. But, uh, not exactly. It's kind of related."
T002,138.84,140.84,2.0,"We're all kind of giving, very, uh."
T002,141.95,147.0,5.05,"Realistic answers, but remember a movie doesn't have to be, you know, set in the real world."
P088,147.1,148.31,1.21,I like monsters.
T002,148.43,158.39,9.96,"Monsters, yeah, that's the third one I got was pretty quick so we had we had cops and cars then monsters. They're the top 3 answers and you felt the world."
T002,159.02,163.05,4.03,So now how do you think you drank these? 'cause she think was the most popular?
P103,165.3,166.45,1.15,Probably cars.
P088,168.66,170.26,1.6,I'd say cars are police.
P088,171.98,176.37,4.39,Followed by cars or police and then monsters lost.
P123,176.48,178.89,2.41,"Yeah, I think I'd agree with that as well."
T002,180.05,188.89,8.84,"OK, so monsters Daphne in last place then and then. OK just which which number will then police their cars just?"
P123,189.28,192.93,3.65,"I feel like police could be #1, but I think that's just."
P088,193.85,196.93,3.08,Yeah I would. I would go with police as well for number 1.
P123,194.06,194.49,0.43,Miguel.
T002,197.49,202.51,5.02,"OK so cops, cars and monsters. You guys help you with that."
T002,204.83,211.78,6.95,"OK, I could reveal that cops actually lost monsters with first and cars with second."
P123,212.53,213.03,0.5,Oh
T002,213.59,214.24,0.65,Yeah.
T002,215.61,223.06,7.45,"I guess it just depends what movies usually watch and someone asks you a lot of people chased by so you watch a lot of sci-fi. You might say monsters, and I don't know."
P088,221.97,222.58,0.61,Yeah.
T002,225.57,228.0,2.43,OK you guys ready for the second question.

T002,273.49,279.67,6.18,"No, actually, weirdly, there's no browse instruments on that top three list of answers, which I think again is really strange."
P123,277.81,278.22,0.41,Oh
P123,279.84,281.38,1.54,"oh, like trumpeter, oh, that's"

T002,304.52,308.98,4.46,"Pianos not under either, which, again, weird, no heart."
P088,306.28,306.86,0.58,Harp.
T002,314.54,322.61,8.07,"OK, we've gone through a lot of sections of the orchestra. We've touched on strings. We've had some woodwinds and stuff. We thought the piano bits and brass stuff."
T002,323.21,328.99,5.78,"What's what's left or close close? Yeah, try and figure out more kind of just general terms."
P088,323.3,324.06,0.76,Symbols.
P103,324.47,325.22,0.75,Percussion.
P103,328.47,329.18,0.71,Gong
T002,329.8,331.27,1.47,No more like general.
P088,330.49,332.92,2.43,Just drums or.
T002,332.28,334.04,1.76,"Yeah, that's the third one."
T002,335.15,340.4,5.25,"OK, let's play uhm yeah, drums is a weird one. I I don't know."
P088,339.95,340.5,0.55,Yeah.
T002,341.39,345.14,3.75,I always I'd say like percussion if we're talking about in orchestra.
P088,345.29,345.78,0.49,Yeah.
T002,346.47,352.09,5.62,"Uh, right? So once we have we had a violin and cello and drums."
T002,352.69,355.27,2.58,So what order do you think you put these in?
P103,356.26,357.35,1.09,Violin first.
P088,357.69,358.25,0.56,Yeah.
T002,357.81,363.0,5.19,"Oh yeah, she says that thought out straight away. I think everyone thinks of violence and violent first."
P123,358.42,358.81,0.39,Yep.
P088,363.16,368.37,5.21,"I would put them in the order that you said I would put in violin, cello, drums to be honest."
T002,368.24,374.38,6.14,"Yeah, I guess that kind of makes sense. The order where we arrived at them while in cello and drums."
T002,375.84,377.04,1.2,Hey you guys all cool with that.
T002,379.26,385.35,6.09,"That is the correct order. Well done, violin first, then cello and drums."
T002,386.94,387.35,0.41,Well.
T002,388.7,391.13,2.43,OK you guys ready for a third question.
T002,392.64,405.73,13.09,"I'm going to point out that this question was asked before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, so bear that in mind when you try and think of the answer is a name, a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu bug."
P103,407.35,407.92,0.57,School.
T002,408.78,410.25,1.47,School yes schools under.
T002,411.1,412.69,1.59,"God, I always think of the school as well."
P116,413.0,413.59,0.59,Also.
T002,415.19,416.36,1.17,"Yeah, hospitals are there."
T002,417.41,418.22,0.81,Two out of three.
P123,418.8,422.23,3.43,"I feel like public transport like trainer both or something like that, sure."
T002,422.78,425.63,2.85,"OK, you're in the right lane, but it's not the training that's not a bus."
P116,427.11,427.7,0.59,Plane.
T002,428.28,433.78,5.5,"Yeah, played well done. OK, that's the third one. So school school, hospital and playing."
T002,434.88,441.59,6.71,"Plane is a funny one. I'd never think of playing, but I did. I just didn't know about that convention. We supposed to get sick on airplanes, but I guess it makes sense."
T002,442.84,444.01,1.17,"Uh, all right?"
T002,444.72,449.28,4.56,"Well, or do you think you put these in there so we have school, hospital, plane?"
T002,450.01,450.58,0.57,Airplane.
P088,451.79,453.5,1.71,I'd put hospital first.
P088,454.65,455.11,0.46,I think.
P088,456.72,457.23,0.51,And.
P088,459.26,460.37,1.11,After that I'm not sure.
T002,459.38,460.63,1.25,Progress you guys think?
P103,461.53,466.98,5.45,Will probably school second because planes aren't as an everyday feature of life for most people.
T002,467.56,468.41,0.85,"Yeah, I guess."
T002,470.5,470.9,0.4,Smell.
T002,472.2,474.71,2.51,Hospital then?
T002,475.55,477.74,2.19,"School, then airplane."
T002,479.16,480.95,1.79,Anyone want to switch those around it anyway?
T002,482.94,484.97,2.03,"Oh good, OK."
T002,486.43,494.4,7.97,"Well, actually schools 1st and then hospital and then airplanes. So airplane was lost but the school and hospital rates pushed around."
T002,496.85,502.1,5.25,What hospitals are either that's another one. I never think of when I think where you'd catch a cold.
T002,503.31,504.8,1.49,"Otherwise, think of like the bus."
T002,509.78,512.49,2.71,Are you guys ready for a 4th 4th question?
T002,516.07,520.16,4.09,"Kind of tricky name, something you do not learn in school."
P103,527.46,528.45,0.99,Money management.
T002,529.95,533.44,3.49,"It's so true, but it's not on there. That's what I always think of."
P088,536.25,538.26,2.01,"Uhm, taxes."
T002,539.0,539.73,0.73,No.
T002,540.37,542.36,1.99,But I wish I'd learned taxes in school.
P088,543.23,544.45,1.22,Uhm?
P116,544.57,546.17,1.6,Monitors or something like that?
T002,546.25,548.36,2.11,"Manage is on there, yet project."
T002,549.76,550.95,1.19,"OK, what other treat?"
T002,559.72,562.54,2.82,"Without manners, no taxes, no money stuff."
P088,559.91,561.18,1.27,Manners.
P103,565.35,566.12,0.77,Respect.
T002,568.03,574.63,6.6,"I've got some manners and respect are kind of in the same vein. Respect isn't on there, but maybe that's kind of covered over by people's minds."
P088,582.91,584.31,1.4,Life skills.
T002,585.94,586.91,0.97,It's not on there.
T002,587.8,591.03,3.23,"Uh, I think for a few more specific things."
T002,600.72,601.84,1.12,It's 12 midnight.
T002,603.21,603.7,0.49,I guess.
T002,605.08,613.47,8.39,"If we're thinking in the vein of like manners, that kind of sounds like something your parents would say to you without your parents would teach you. Trying to think of other things that they."
T002,614.22,617.61,3.39,They might tell you to do that. You wouldn't be taught in school.
P116,625.41,626.55,1.14,Like housework.
T002,627.13,631.38,4.25,"Yeah yeah. House house chores, that's all, that's the, that's the second one."
T002,632.35,635.53,3.18,Some Honors High School has chores.
T002,638.39,639.42,1.03,And there's one more.
T002,642.31,650.09,7.78,This is a tough one 'cause I feel like it's very dependent on kind of your stage of life at the time. Like someone asks you what don't you learn in school.
T002,651.76,657.27,5.51,"And maybe kind of our parents generation would be like, oh manners, they don't teach them manners in school these days."
T002,658.51,660.6,2.09,But we don't be like taxes.
P088,661.3,661.76,0.46,Sure.
P088,665.19,665.8,0.61,Mike
P116,668.68,670.57,1.89,I don't know who is it like.
P088,670.0,670.67,0.67,really.
P088,671.6,672.45,0.85,"No, what we gonna say."
P116,672.74,677.99,5.25,I was going to say is it kind of like related to like up being at home or anything like that.
T002,678.58,681.15,2.57,Yeah it is a.
T002,682.33,687.46,5.13,Try and think of something related to like with any responsibilities he might have.
P103,688.28,689.39,1.11,Time management.
T002,690.36,691.11,0.75,No.
T002,692.32,694.41,2.09,"Uh, so like?"
T002,695.86,699.41,3.55,Responsibilities you might have in the future that you don't have when you're in school.
T002,700.1,700.73,0.63,Generally.
P103,701.07,701.84,0.77,Parenting.
T002,702.19,704.16,1.97,"Yeah, parenting helpful also."
T002,705.6,715.25,9.65,"OK, so we have we had manners 1st and then has choice and then parenting really see what I mean when it's I feel like it's kind of a generational thing or something."
T002,717.34,720.65,3.31,"OK, So what order? Which one do you think would come first?"
P123,722.08,724.49,2.41,I feel like matters number one is probably going to be.
P123,727.03,728.38,1.35,I'm scared but the other team.
T002,729.44,729.95,0.51,Yeah.
P088,729.59,730.82,1.23,"Yeah, I."
T002,730.55,732.07,1.52,Why do you think mine is number 1?
P123,733.1,738.31,5.21,"As you said it, feel like it would be like a generational thing where older people would be like, oh, that you just don't learn more free space so."
T002,736.85,737.26,0.41,Yeah.
P088,739.91,742.56,2.65,Yeah yeah yeah. Manners and then.
P103,746.21,752.62,6.41,Probably housework. Next because parenting is being put off longer and longer now so it's harder to see the effects.
P088,750.65,751.24,0.59,Yeah.
T002,753.21,754.4,1.19,"Yeah, I suppose."
P088,754.18,754.59,0.41,Yeah.
T002,756.26,760.49,4.23,A man is then has toys and then parenting you think?
T002,761.83,762.27,0.44,Yeah.
T002,763.43,763.95,0.52,OK.
T002,764.63,766.67,2.04,"Actually, parenting was first."
T002,768.18,772.51,4.33,So most people said parenting and then manners with SEC and then house chores.
T002,773.14,775.47,2.33,So order right except for parenting number one.
T002,777.24,777.83,0.59,Strange.
T002,778.95,785.2,6.25,I suppose we don't know if this is like asked. Currently I'm not sure when this like quiz or survey or whatever took place.
T002,787.06,798.96,11.9,"Uhm, well, so last question we're gonna do so. Thank you so much for your participating really means a lot and we've been funny. Very tough to get participants, so thank you really, really help you with that."
