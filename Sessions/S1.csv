P017,29.8,35.56,5.76,"It's the top three most popular, not the top three right ones I suppose OK."
T002,34.55,46.24,11.69,"Yes, so not the ones you think are the most correct, just the ones that you think are the most common. And then after after you've selected the top three, I'll ask you to rank them in order of popularity."
P017,39.61,40.04,0.43,Yeah.
P011,47.01,47.49,0.48,Alright.

P017,78.75,81.76,3.01,"Yeah, I would have to say animals as animals gonna."
T002,81.43,92.44,11.01,"Yeah, you're like you're allowed to say I'm going to tell you none of these are quite hitting what's on the list yet. So, uh, you know. Maybe think of films you've seen things that have chased people."

P011,99.82,100.46,0.64,Perineum?
P011,103.56,108.72,5.16,"Well, other people is probably like the obvious one which we are missing, kinda."

P011,121.18,122.3,1.12,OK Sir.
P017,123.88,127.48,3.6,"Zombies is probably up there as well. Maybe not top three, but."
T002,128.59,135.29,6.7,"OK, you said a few things. Like someone that you said aliens. You said zombies, but what about a broader kind of?"
P011,128.61,129.26,0.65,Or
P011,134.87,137.58,2.71,"oh, monsters is the broader term, isn't it?"
T002,137.14,139.95,2.81,"Yeah yeah that's it. OK, two out of three."
P017,141.1,141.67,0.57,Rice
P011,141.15,149.42,8.27,"And then wildlife if we're going with a very broad terms, 'cause like I've seen you see lions, you see bears, you see dogs. You see all of these things."
P011,150.38,151.13,0.75,Uhm?
P017,151.44,152.09,0.65,and.
T002,151.8,153.29,1.49,"That ain't on there, sorry."
P011,153.02,153.89,0.87,Oh
P017,154.39,154.8,0.41,Me.
T002,156.65,165.88,9.23,"So we've kinda looked at the, you know sci-fi domain. What about the more kind of general TV stuff or movie stuff?"
P011,166.13,168.62,2.49,cars like yeah.
T002,167.23,171.96,4.73,"Yeah yeah, you're on fire Christian, OK?"

P017,172.16,172.65,0.49,yeah.
T002,173.45,175.66,2.21,"Fair play that was really quick, uh?"
T002,176.35,193.88,17.53,So the top three are we had we had police first costs as they said in the 3rd right here at W at monsters. Then we had cars right? So now you guys have to think of an order. How would you rank these things so?
T002,194.99,198.58,3.59,Which with which would be the most popular chosen answer?
P017,196.0,196.47,0.47,Yeah.
T002,199.28,202.61,3.33,"And the second most in the third most, what do you guys think?"
P017,202.72,211.35,8.63,"I think monsters are probably least popular just because like when you think of a chase, it's cop chase or car chase. You don't really think Monster Chase."
P011,211.81,222.34,10.53,"I I agree with that at Julie and I would say that monsters is third out of the three, but for me for cars versus cops, it's a coin toss."
P017,222.62,223.15,0.53,Yeah.
P017,223.71,231.08,7.37,"'cause, like cop chases happen in cars as often as they don't, so does that count? Is calculator catch Ace or both?"
P017,232.1,232.63,0.53,Uhm?
T002,232.16,237.4,5.24,Strange thing about people would have said Oliver Liam you got any any thoughts?
P026,237.63,247.36,9.73,"I agree with that thing. Masters will be third one and then for the first. Uh, I don't know. Probably caps, uh, but uh, yeah reason behind it."
T002,239.14,239.64,0.5,Yeah.
P026,249.18,250.73,1.55,Little yeah.
T002,249.39,249.95,0.56,Yeah.
P025,250.72,252.39,1.67,Let's say I'd say corpses first.

P011,253.36,256.11,2.75,"I'm good to go, I'm good, I'm good to go with that so."
P017,253.51,254.6,1.09,"Fair enough, yeah?"
P017,255.51,256.18,0.67,"Yes, I'm."
T002,255.84,259.92,4.08,"So final order cops, cars, monsters."

P017,271.69,272.27,0.58,Really.
P011,271.9,273.68,1.78,"Woah, monsters is first."
T002,273.76,275.43,1.67,"Yeah, monster."
P017,276.36,276.73,0.37,Oh
P011,276.88,280.77,3.89,I don't watch enough horror movies to even consider that.
T002,280.82,282.56,1.74,The people said.
P017,283.98,284.42,0.44,yeah.

P026,319.93,320.53,0.6,Finally.
P017,320.83,321.9,1.07,"Yeah, but then."
T002,323.86,326.35,2.49,"Yeah, that's all their fair play."
