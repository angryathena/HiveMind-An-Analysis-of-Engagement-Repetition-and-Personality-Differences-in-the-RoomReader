P042,223.86,225.97,2.11,"Cops will be, I'd say, #1 now."
P009,224.03,224.43,0.4,I think.
P009,225.73,227.84,2.11,"I think yeah, I think cops number one."

P042,245.8,246.47,0.67,I got it.
T002,247.06,253.42,6.36,"OK, so you guys are putting cops 1st and then monsters and cars at that final answer."
P042,250.52,250.79,0.27,Yeah.
P039,251.25,251.64,0.39,Yeah.
P009,251.35,251.73,0.38,Yep.

P039,263.21,267.62,4.41,"You see, I feel like monsters is such a general category."
T002,263.3,263.92,0.62,But I.
P039,268.3,276.17,7.87,"That there could be so many things to fall under Monster, so there might be more things that fall into that category than just the police."
P042,269.53,270.07,0.54,News.
P009,273.95,274.41,0.46,Yeah.
P009,276.84,277.5,0.66,"Well, yeah."
P039,276.94,282.59,5.65,"But then I also associate like the police with cars, so for me they're like one of the same, you know?"
P042,282.4,288.53,6.13,"Yeah, that's why I was thinking. I kind of left anything related to humans. Kind of outside, like a car that's."
P042,289.28,290.01,0.73,There.
P039,289.68,303.6,13.92,"And like I don't know, I just kind of. I feel like I'm grasping at straws here, but like police has its own jondra of cars so cars is more general than police, so baby cars is above police."
T002,300.51,301.22,0.71,Yeah.
P042,303.76,308.26,4.5,"Yeah, OK, yeah, I think so too. It makes sense."

P042,319.57,320.26,0.69,Oh God.
P039,319.78,325.33,5.55,I don't know. I feel like it's a toss up between cars and monsters at the top and then.
P042,325.77,326.86,1.09,Police last.
P039,326.33,327.8,1.47,"Please heard, yeah."
P039,329.98,335.65,5.67,"Cars are more real than like monsters, so maybe yeah."
T002,333.6,340.67,7.07,"But this is movies so like and again. Remember this isn't like logical, that's just what people said off the top of their head when they were asked so."
P009,335.57,336.78,1.21,When you think of movie.
P039,338.63,339.08,0.45,Yeah.

P039,1244.6,1256.33,11.73,"Definitely not everybody has kids to learn the whole parenting thing. 'cause I think from our own age group from perspective we're like parenting loss, but it's because we haven't reached that point yet."

P039,1257.8,1260.21,2.41,"Uhm, I don't know. I'm a little tired."

P042,1288.48,1294.05,5.57,But like we don't know how many people in the survey would have had or didn't.
T002,1288.77,1289.42,0.65,Yeah.
T002,1292.29,1295.88,3.59,"Yeah, this one does feel very generation specific, doesn't it?"
P039,1298.67,1299.34,0.67,Uhm?
P042,1299.26,1302.51,3.25,"So I do want to say manners as well, but I don't want to be wrong."
P039,1305.56,1307.63,2.07,I don't know. I'm kind of torn on this one.

T002,1332.41,1332.9,0.49,Feds
P009,1333.29,1337.52,4.23,I don't think chores would be the thing people are really saying needs to be taught in school like.
T002,1338.54,1339.79,1.25,yeah like that.
P039,1338.93,1342.75,3.82,"Yeah, it's kind of it. Yeah, it's common sense at the same time some stuff."
