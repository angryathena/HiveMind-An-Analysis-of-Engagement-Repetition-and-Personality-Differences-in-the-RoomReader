T002,0.04,11.59,11.55,Recording that so we can go ahead. So what we're going to do today is play a quiz game and you might be familiar with this game. If you've ever watched the TV show family feud or family Fight.
T002,12.24,28.19,15.95,"Uhm, but if you haven't, no worries 'cause I'm gonna go ahead and explain the game anyway, so I'm gonna ask you guys a question and this question was also asked to 100 people in a survey and you have to guess the most popular answers given in the survey. So the top 3 answers."
T002,28.96,37.63,8.67,"Like for example, if I asked you to name something people are afraid of, he might come up with spiders, heights and other people."
T002,38.77,46.38,7.61,"Uhm, and then I'm gonna ask you to rank these in order of popularity. So in this case the most popular would be spiders."
T002,46.99,49.32,2.33,And then heights number two other people #3.
T002,50.54,58.01,7.47,"Uh, so yeah, I don't remember that. They're not necessarily the most like correct answers, they're just what most people said."
T002,59.67,61.74,2.07,Any questions is that kind of clear enough.
T002,63.95,70.6,6.65,"Yeah, and you're working together this scenario, not like competing or anything, so you could just chat it whatever and give each other ideas."
T002,71.75,73.4,1.65,Guys ready for the first question.
P104,74.61,74.83,0.22,But
P090,75.11,75.5,0.39,Yep.
P087,75.11,75.5,0.39,Yep.
T002,76.61,77.04,0.43,Cool.
T002,78.39,81.82,3.43,Name something people are often chased by in movies?
T002,85.45,87.88,2.43,"Cars, yeah, that's that's one of them when I intrigued."
P104,88.92,89.67,0.75,the police.
T002,89.14,89.75,0.61,Pretty quick.
T002,90.57,97.85,7.28,"Yeah, that's another one. OK, it's a two out of three that was pretty quick. I think they actually said cops the same thing called police."
P104,97.52,98.17,0.65,Dogs.
T002,99.21,100.58,1.37,Dogs isn't on there.
P090,101.47,102.29,0.82,Serial killers
P087,101.47,102.29,0.82,Serial killers
T002,103.44,112.27,8.83,That's not on there either. I guess he's really kind of related to policing cars and cereal. Commercial T feels like he's bringing to mind a certain genre film.
T002,117.35,123.2,5.85,Try and think of the last time you saw in the last people. So what was their chasewater people being chased by?
P104,124.65,127.8,3.15,"So my evil character, like in a horror storm."
P086,127.18,128.14,0.96,"Yeah, the villain."
T002,129.58,131.47,1.89,"Bill isn't on there, but."
T002,132.23,133.91,1.68,"Yeah, you're kinda in the right bang."
T002,135.15,136.64,1.49,Like people already had kind of.
T002,137.55,145.1,7.55,"Say, uh, the kind of cop cars. Kind of a more realistic movie genre, but yes, in a in a horror film or in a fantasy film."
P104,146.79,147.57,0.78,Guests.
T002,148.5,149.66,1.16,Ghost isn't on there.
T002,150.41,153.24,2.83,But it's kind of related in the right direction.
T002,157.44,159.13,1.69,Try to think of a more general term.
P104,162.28,162.97,0.69,The body.
P086,162.3,164.0,1.7,Some kind of like monster?
T002,164.25,170.52,6.27,"Monster, yeah, that's it. That's well done. OK so we had we had cars."
T002,171.08,181.35,10.27,"Cops and monsters. So those are the top 3 answers and now I'm gonna ask you which order you think we should go in, which is number 1 less than most popular, do you think?"
T002,184.61,185.3,0.69,Cops
T002,186.27,190.09,3.82,"yeah, 'cause I make sense so cops cops number one."
P104,191.53,192.58,1.05,Then maybe monster.
P104,195.13,195.76,0.63,Phone calls.
T002,196.14,198.57,2.43,And then that would leave cars lost.
T002,199.7,203.01,3.31,Anyone else got any ideas? Anyone else wanna change these around or?
T002,205.62,210.37,4.75,So cops number would then monsters number 2 on cars #3.
T002,211.55,211.96,0.41,Yeah.
P086,212.32,213.19,0.87,"Yeah, that makes sense."
T002,213.93,214.44,0.51,OK.
T002,215.74,218.81,3.07,I can reveal that actually monsters this number 1.
T002,219.67,221.45,1.78,And then parse and then costs.
P104,223.33,223.81,0.48,Hello.
T002,223.37,229.4,6.03,A completely different over there. I guess it really depends on what kind of movies you watched it someone ask you that question.
T002,231.66,232.15,0.49,I don't know.
T002,233.53,239.54,6.01,"Alright, well I'll do it anyway. You guys ready for it? The second question really do a few of these."
P086,240.88,241.47,0.59,Yeah.
T002,242.31,242.74,0.43,Cool.

P087,249.61,250.15,0.54,Violent.
P090,249.61,250.15,0.54,Violent.
T002,251.01,253.4,2.39,"Yeah, violins on there one out of three."
P104,252.92,253.42,0.5,Darn it.

T002,276.38,276.99,0.61,No.
T002,279.09,296.58,17.49,"It's really weird 'cause there's only three, and we've already said too on their violin and cello, so there's only one left at piano wasn't on there, which is really weird. Again, I'd always put piano kind as my first guest. Double bass is not there either. He kind of funny it was all just string instruments. No, not Viola."
P090,279.3,279.77,0.47,Yeah.
P087,279.3,279.77,0.47,Yeah.

P087,306.1,308.69,2.59,"I don't remember what it's called, but like the little triangle thing."
T002,309.69,319.88,10.19,"Cook this called a triangle I think, but uh, no, that's not on there either. But yeah, I guess that's kind of moving closer to the third one I have in my head."
P090,311.14,311.74,0.6,OK.
P087,311.14,311.74,0.6,OK.
P086,319.1,321.53,2.43,Is it like a drama or something?
T002,321.38,340.31,18.93,"Yeah, drums, that's it. That was the third one. So yeah, I think kind of weird selection. I feel like there's so many but again it's not like supposed to be representative of any kind of correct answer. It's just what people said. So we had violin, cello and drums. Those are the three now. What would you put? Number one?"
P087,341.0,341.85,0.85,It's a violin.
P090,341.0,341.85,0.85,It's a violin.
P104,341.83,342.34,0.51,Online.
T002,342.81,345.39,2.58,"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Like you said that straight away so."
T002,346.03,347.12,1.09,Find their number one.
P086,346.18,347.81,1.63,I'd like to order against them.

P086,349.28,349.71,0.43,Yeah.
T002,349.74,352.87,3.13,"Violin cello, drums."
T002,354.65,356.25,1.6,Herbal and happy enough with that.
T002,358.97,360.39,1.42,What is the right order?
T002,361.34,363.9,2.56,So well done gets it correctly.
T002,365.03,370.2,5.17,"Super weird, well, I always think that piano is like gonna be on there somewhere, but I guess if you only have 3."
T002,371.6,375.03,3.43,Three top answers. It's going to be a very narrow selection.
P104,373.52,373.99,0.47,Is it?
P104,375.3,377.23,1.93,Is a piano in a Symphony Orchestra?

P104,384.21,385.82,1.61,Like a human ear drums.
T002,384.26,384.95,0.69,Yeah.
T002,386.89,397.92,11.03,"Yeah, I always think more of like they mean specific things like I would have said timpani or something. But I associate drums more with kinda like live rock or pop music."
P104,387.55,388.03,0.48,Question.
P087,397.04,397.47,0.43,Yeah.
P090,397.04,397.47,0.43,Yeah.
T002,398.68,405.16,6.48,"But yeah, I got again. I guess this is just out of the selection of people they asked, they just said drums."
T002,405.97,406.52,0.55,Uhm?
T002,407.87,414.64,6.77,"I'm not sure about piano, but I always just associated with classical music. I guess I don't know much about what is actually in the Symphony Orchestra."
T002,415.32,419.33,4.01,"Again, weird that there is no brass, and no like woodwind instruments."
T002,422.13,424.32,2.19,Violence against two popular against.

T002,532.06,537.65,5.59,"I always think of bus more than airplane, but maybe that's like COVID brain since I haven't been on a plane and so long."
T002,538.53,539.44,0.91,Uhm?
T002,540.34,542.91,2.57,"Alright, So what do you think that would be #1?"
