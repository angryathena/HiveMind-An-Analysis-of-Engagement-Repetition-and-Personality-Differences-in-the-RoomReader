Today we're going to play a quiz so I'm going to ask you as a team a question that was asked to 100 people and you need to give me the tree most popular answers to that question. And after you get the three most popular answers to that question, I'm going to ask you to rank them from most popular to least popular. So, for example, if I asked you name something that people are afraid of, you might say things like heights, spiders, and other people."
T001,29.64,34.43,4.79,"And the ranking from most popular to least popular would be spiders heights, other people."
