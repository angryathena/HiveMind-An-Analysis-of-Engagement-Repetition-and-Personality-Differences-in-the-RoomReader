T002,0.05,28.64,28.59,"Yeah, I think that's recording that we can go ahead. And So what we're going to be doing today is playing a quiz game and it's one that you might be familiar with. If you've ever watched the TV show family feud or family Fight. But if you haven't, don't worry. 'cause I'm gonna explain it anyway, so I'm gonna ask you guys a question which was also asked to 100 people in a survey. And you've got to guess the most popular answers given to the question like the top three."
T002,29.3,49.36,20.06,"So say I asked you name something people are afraid of, you might come up with spiders heights and other people just what they said in the survey, and then afterwards I'm going to ask you to rank these 3 answers in order of popularity. So in this case the most popular with spiders and heights and other people."
T002,50.76,51.99,1.23,It's not kind of clear enough.
T002,52.89,59.74,6.85,"Yeah Oh yeah, and in this scenario you're not like competing or anything. You just like share the answers and try to guess them together."
T002,60.76,63.92,3.16,"So OK, we ready for the first question?"
T002,66.44,66.99,0.55,Cool.
T002,68.56,71.9,3.34,Name something people are often chased by in movies?
P110,76.04,76.3,0.26,Please.
T002,77.3,88.4,11.1,"The police, yeah, that's that's one of them. One out of three. They actually said cops I think. Well, same gift. I think it was an American survey, maybe so cops one out of three. Sorry, what did you say?"
P121,85.54,85.82,0.28,So.
P121,88.54,89.55,1.01,Murder of.
T002,89.92,93.61,3.69,"Murder rates milder, but I feel like that's kind of the same thing."
P135,96.32,97.37,1.05,Baby tigers
T002,98.23,99.68,1.45,Tigers is not there.
T002,102.28,107.09,4.81,Try to think of the last time you saw and if there was a chase in it. What was happening in the chase?
P110,110.81,111.65,0.84,Villains.
T002,113.06,116.23,3.17,Billings isn't on there either. I guess that's the Super broad term.
T002,117.88,118.71,0.83,Uh.
T002,121.38,123.16,1.78,Any other suggestions?
T002,127.96,132.81,4.85,"What about, say, come? So we plugged police, oh sorry, go ahead."
T002,135.12,136.04,0.92,So let's say something.
P117,135.61,139.65,4.04,"I was gonna say I was gonna say car but I don't know if that's too broad, yeah?"
T002,138.0,144.95,6.95,"Hi yeah, no, that's that's that's two out of three. No cars on the list so we got cops and cars. There's one more."
P117,141.86,142.37,0.51,Sick.
T002,146.02,154.82,8.8,"And as a hint, try and think of like, OK, so cops and cars are kinda in one genre trying to give another genre maybe less kinda realistic."
T002,162.21,164.82,2.61,Let's say you're watching a fantasy or horror film.
T002,166.25,167.36,1.11,Why would she be chased by?
P117,167.3,167.75,0.45,Zombie.
T002,168.84,181.71,12.87,"Zombies, girls in this in the right direction but trending kind of other things monster. Yeah, that's the third one fairplay OK so we had yeah cops first cars and monsters."
P110,173.48,174.51,1.03,Monsters.
T002,182.55,185.37,2.82,Now what do you think? How do you think you drank these?
T002,187.86,189.16,1.3,"So what's number one, do you think?"
P117,188.27,193.44,5.17,"Probably probably not saying order. I'd say cops, cars, monsters, there's no."
P121,193.81,194.54,0.73,Why don't you say that?
P117,194.47,194.98,0.51,I'd say.
T002,195.82,196.15,0.33,No.
P110,195.86,196.43,0.57,Yeah.
T002,196.88,199.61,2.73,Anyone disagree with that at all? I want to shift some things around.
P135,202.33,204.81,2.48,TV cars first uh.
P135,205.86,209.45,3.59,"By cops, cops probably comes probably will be first time I'm torn."
T002,210.2,214.19,3.99,"Yeah, it's hard 'cause I feel like cops are always in a car anyway."
P135,213.92,215.65,1.73,Chasing everybody guys.
T002,215.26,215.85,0.59,Yeah.
P117,215.63,216.08,0.45,Sure.
T002,218.41,225.35,6.94,"And remember, they're not like necessarily the most correct on series, but like make the most sense. It's just kind of what most people said."
P121,226.05,228.62,2.57,We're just guessing what would be the most popular answer.
T002,228.95,229.37,0.42,Yeah.
T002,233.66,236.67,3.01,So what are we going with for number one? So it cops their cars.
P135,237.5,238.41,0.91,They cups.
T002,239.23,239.76,0.53,Cops
P135,239.28,241.2,1.92,There's there's a general agreement.
T002,241.57,245.75,4.18,"OK, so costs cards and then monsters we go with that."
P117,246.74,247.27,0.53,And so.
T002,247.88,258.27,10.39,"OK, I can reveal that monsters is actually 1st and then cars and then cops so hard look 'cause but almost there."
P135,257.99,259.1,1.11,Got #2 right?
P117,259.14,260.25,1.11,"Oh, you got one right?"
T002,260.56,272.92,12.36,"Yeah yeah, I feel like it's a weird one that it really depends what kind of films you watch. Usually if you're asked or like what was the last movie you watched. Maybe monsters is just general, I don't know."
P117,270.47,270.89,0.42,To.
T002,274.18,277.48,3.3,"Anyway, uh, you guys only do another question you ready."

T002,339.61,345.97,6.36,"Yeah, I guess it's kind of kind of a weird one. So OK. Violin cello and drums."
T002,346.86,358.21,11.35,"I always got confused with what is. Actually I don't really know what's in orchestra, but I always associate like even just the word drums more with kind of pop music or rock. Like if I went to a live event somewhere."
T002,359.22,361.02,1.8,"Well, I guess they are still drums."
T002,362.4,366.23,3.83,"Uhm, alright, well or do we want to write these in there?"

T002,380.81,381.28,0.47,Yeah.
T002,383.27,385.14,1.87,And then that would leave cello third.
T002,387.06,388.2,1.14,How do you guys think of that?
T002,391.33,392.8,1.47,Anyone agree disagree?
P117,393.57,394.93,1.36,"I'd probably agree with that, yeah?"
T002,397.22,401.55,4.33,"OK, so by then first drum, second challenge third."
T002,402.46,409.97,7.51,"I was almost right. Biden was first, but cello was second and then drums. So it's actually the same order that you called them right in."
P135,410.38,412.05,1.67,Real tough game.
T002,411.63,413.14,1.51,"Yeah, yeah."

P135,445.54,446.31,0.77,Relevant.
T002,445.63,446.14,0.51,Everywhere.
P121,447.57,448.24,0.67,Night club

P121,453.35,454.58,1.23,at night club.
T002,454.95,467.88,12.93,"No, it's it's not really COVID themed answer. I would say that I feel like I, I think of nightclub now 'cause I haven't been allowed in a nightclub in like a year, but I definitely wouldn't have said that before. I'd be like locked out of all night clubs."
T002,469.41,470.52,1.11,So that's not on there.
P110,470.99,471.85,0.86,Hospitals.
T002,472.69,475.3,2.61,"After this other OK, well, it's really nice."

P110,488.92,492.41,3.49,"Is it like more generic, like public transporters only?"
T002,492.87,498.46,5.59,"No, it's a type, a type of transport, but not above. Searching what you say."
P110,495.13,495.66,0.53,OK.
P117,496.26,496.63,0.37,And.

T002,513.67,516.1,2.43,"No, it is that was good feelings, right?"
T002,517.49,522.84,5.35,I feel like schools are just like hotbeds of infection. Whatever stage of life you're in like.
P110,521.74,522.31,0.57,Yeah.

T002,544.38,549.97,5.59,Feel like that was the thing I think my friend had months. That's it. That's a big one. This is scary scary illness.
T002,552.91,554.46,1.55,So glad I'm not in school anymore.
P121,554.73,555.14,0.41,She.
T002,556.3,562.1,5.8,"OK, so we had hostile hostile airplane and school."
T002,562.98,566.53,3.55,What order do you think would be like? What would be the most popular these?
P117,567.44,568.83,1.39,hospital at Imagine now.
P110,569.39,570.0,0.61,Yeah.
T002,572.53,574.6,2.07,The hospital #1
P110,576.96,581.65,4.69,I probably put school #2 and then airplane at the bottom.
P117,579.44,580.82,1.38,"Yeah, I definitely would not."
T002,582.39,582.86,0.47,yeah.

T002,590.42,604.59,14.17,"It's actually schoolhouse still airplane, so minor shift. And where do I feel like everyone has like either somebody works in a school or was in school recently, or like a sibling who's in schools? Maybe just think it's cool all the time wherever you are."
T002,605.5,606.23,0.73,Netflix.
T002,607.61,609.64,2.03,Airplane is another weird one that.
T002,610.4,612.65,2.25,I definitely wouldn't associate that much with.
T002,613.42,613.87,0.45,Like
T002,614.93,622.53,7.6,"getting a cold or flu, but maybe that's just like COVID brain 'cause I haven't been on a plane in so long. I'd always say the bus."
