T002,4.59,34.6,30.01,"Well, the recording seems to have started, so we can go ahead and start. So what we're going to be doing today is, you know, kind of easy and relax. It's just going to be playing a quiz game and you might have heard of this game if you've ever watched the TV show family feud or Family Fight. But if you haven't, don't worry. 'cause I'm going to explain it now anyway, so I'm going to ask you guys a question and you have to think of the most popular answers to this question. So this question was also asked. 100 people in some survey."
T002,35.16,44.53,9.37,"And you have to guess, kind of the top 3 answers and I'll tell you when you put on the top 3 answers and then afterwards I'm gonna ask you to rank them in order of popularity."
T002,45.47,46.29,0.82,"So, uh."
T002,47.49,62.12,14.63,"Yeah, for example, one of the questions is name something people are afraid of and you might say things like spiders heights or other people at the top 3 answers. In that case, with spiders being number one."
T002,62.98,70.01,7.03,"Uhm, alright, and you're free to discuss with each other just like shout out things until you hit on something that's in the top three."
T002,71.26,72.97,1.71,Any questions little clear.
T002,74.91,77.15,2.24,OK you guys ready for the first question.
P175,78.52,78.83,0.31,Yeah.
T002,80.0,82.13,2.13,"Cool, right?"
T002,82.78,86.19,3.41,Name something people are often chased by in movies?
P175,89.29,89.83,0.54,Cat.
T002,90.61,95.0,4.39,"Cats, no, that's not a miss, but I'd like to see that film."
P181,94.14,94.85,0.71,And.
P122,95.41,97.74,2.33,It monster is that too broad?
T002,97.34,102.82,5.48,"Yeah, no monsters on there. That's that's what I did. The three killer isn't on there."
P122,99.39,100.76,1.37,K cool.
P181,99.85,100.82,0.97,Or killer?
P175,102.19,102.7,0.51,Damn.
T002,104.51,106.24,1.73,Oh Elizabeth.
P181,105.29,105.82,0.53,And.
P175,105.32,106.11,0.79,The cops.

P122,107.07,107.96,0.89,Yeah please.
T002,107.67,108.84,1.17,Did you say something?
T002,109.61,117.78,8.17,"Uh, OK, mom stresses on their corpses on there, uh, there is another. OK, this is great. So two out of three, there's one more left."
T002,127.26,127.86,0.6,Yeah.
T002,129.41,131.71,2.3,"Hold on fire today, OK?"
T002,132.35,144.55,12.2,So that's the three of them. We had some of the we said monsters 1st and then cops and then cars. So now you have to put these in order. So what do you think is the number one? The most popular answer?
P122,148.36,153.88,5.52,Maybe monster 'cause that's like a whole genre like horror movies. Maybe that would come to people's minds first.
T002,152.37,152.88,0.51,Yeah.
T002,154.29,160.64,6.35,"Yeah OK, uhm I will drive well. What does everyone else think of putting monsters Priest?"
P181,164.02,170.56,6.54,Maybe car just because it's so like there can be a car in any type of movie tonight maybe?
T002,168.93,169.5,0.57,Yeah.
P175,169.89,170.37,0.48,Yeah.
P122,170.01,170.34,0.33,Yeah.
T002,171.27,173.34,2.07,I guess the car chase is a real classic.
T002,173.95,175.7,1.75,"Uhm, OK."
T002,177.05,179.66,2.61,Maybe we'll take like a consensus.
T002,180.37,183.78,3.41,Teen monsters in cars? Or does that even think cops should be first?
P175,186.65,194.71,8.06,"I mean, I guess it's it's like what are you being chased by cops? And then you go oh cars. And then you say oh OK, yeah, monsters do you know?"
T002,190.85,191.44,0.59,Yeah.
T002,195.57,196.2,0.63,Yeah.
P122,195.62,198.76,3.14,"It's hard to say, right? Yeah, I don't know, yeah."
T002,197.33,198.21,0.88,Yeah.
T002,199.66,204.94,5.28,"It's hard, I guess. It really depends on what kind of movies you watch. What's the first thing that's gonna pop into your head?"
T002,206.6,207.31,0.71,Uhm?
T002,209.26,209.93,0.67,OK.
T002,212.16,224.31,12.15,"So God Gabriel is making the case for monsters, and Charlie, you think cars better you think cops? Elizabeth, what do you think? Maybe you can do the deciding vote."
P175,224.42,224.86,0.44,Yeah.
P148,226.39,227.0,0.61,Come.
P148,228.14,229.95,1.81,"Yeah, I think I'd, uh."
P148,231.65,233.04,1.39,Are monsters cops?
T002,234.12,234.73,0.61,Yeah.
T002,235.4,237.05,1.65,So cars number one then.
P148,235.5,235.95,0.45,Yeah.
T002,237.79,238.95,1.16,Have people feel about that.

P122,241.15,243.52,2.37,"I think that can be that can be our consensus, yeah?"
T002,243.53,246.64,3.11,OK so cars and then monsters number 2 and then call.
P175,247.42,248.31,0.89,Are we right?
T002,249.57,267.91,18.34,"I can reveal that actually, monsters is number one, yeah and then and then cars and then cops left. So you did get the one of the positions right? Yeah, so hard to guess. I just it really depends. I suppose I'll type agenda and movies that people are thinking. Oh I don't know."
P175,252.64,253.21,0.57,Oh
P122,252.94,253.57,0.63,Ah.

P148,310.52,313.01,2.49,So I'm assuming it's gonna be another string instrument.

P148,316.15,316.52,0.37,OK.

P181,413.8,414.42,0.62,I'm.

P175,441.98,447.65,5.67,"Yeah, I agree, I think I think people just lost count and they said, OK, you know what? What else could be in their drums?"
P175,448.69,451.62,2.93,And then there's that. That should be the order.

P148,518.51,519.24,0.73,On the plane.
P181,518.96,519.49,0.53,Money.
T002,519.56,530.19,10.63,"Yeah played so planes yeah so hospital is one of them and then airplane was one of them as well, which I'd never think of. But maybe that's just sort of being abroad in so long."
P175,520.79,521.34,0.55,OK.
P181,528.83,529.37,0.54,Yeah.

T002,539.75,544.41,4.66,"There are, you know. OK, so I heard restaurant and they were like two more things. What were the rest of?"
P122,544.92,547.09,2.17,A nursery or school?
T002,547.71,549.55,1.84,"At school, that's that's #3."
P181,548.9,549.93,1.03,"Ah, OK."
P175,549.56,551.59,2.03,"Ah, yeah, actually."
P122,549.91,550.58,0.67,Cool.
T002,551.1,551.61,0.51,Yeah.
T002,552.73,561.34,8.61,"Yeah, God, when I think of the school now there's like 4 primary schools in my area and every time I see like these streams, a kids party and so it just makes me stressed out."
T002,565.69,566.3,0.61,A lot.
T002,567.8,576.76,8.96,"OK, so we have to treat them. We had a hospital airplane on school well. Or do you think you put these in in popularity?"
P181,577.28,578.81,1.53,Probably hospital first.
P181,579.74,580.39,0.65,Uhm?
T002,582.5,583.76,1.26,What do you think also first?
P181,584.99,591.5,6.51,Just 'cause I feel like that would be the first thing that would string to mind to someone like pre COVID. Like if they're thinking they're gonna catch a cold.
T002,589.86,590.46,0.6,Yeah.
T002,592.98,593.73,0.75,"Yeah, I guess."
P148,594.13,595.34,1.21,Then I was surprised by.
T002,594.95,596.24,1.29,The medical setting.
P181,597.02,597.89,0.87,Yeah.
T002,597.24,598.8,1.56,"Yeah, playing is weird."
T002,599.64,600.91,1.27,And it's a bit of an odd one.
P175,603.15,608.33,5.18,"I think actually they say schools, hospitals and then planes, you know."
P181,607.82,609.77,1.95,"Yeah, maybe actually."
T002,608.18,608.84,0.66,OK.
T002,609.53,621.57,12.04,"Yeah, I guess a lot of people either have been to a school or have a child in school, or you know somebody's in school. OK, maybe that makes school a hospital airplane."
T002,622.96,624.27,1.31,That is the correct order.
P122,624.83,625.63,0.8,Wow.
P175,625.81,626.69,0.88,Yay.
T002,626.61,627.07,0.46,Yeah.

P175,641.93,642.44,0.51,Oh
T002,643.37,645.46,2.09,Maybe I'm thinking just of primary skills though.
P175,645.95,646.44,0.49,yeah.
P122,646.22,648.71,2.49,"No, it's all kids. They don't know how to wash their hands."
T002,647.81,650.38,2.57,"Yeah no, I just don't."
P122,649.78,652.05,2.27,I work with kids and they don't. They don't know how.
T002,653.47,656.63,3.16,"Yeah, I know this first hand I just."
T002,658.57,677.56,18.99,"There's like a baby who lives across the road for me, and sometimes she comes over and plays in my garden. Down here. They're just like I'm I'm much more stressed that her mom is 'cause the the baby is there, like eating stones and so called grand and I'm like really just jump but she is. She allowed to do that. She's like Oh no she won't eat them. Don't worry she'll spit them out fun."
P181,678.08,679.99,1.91,Bells of the immunity.
P175,680.1,680.83,0.73,Wow.

T002,691.75,694.0,2.25,OK question is.
T002,694.79,697.05,2.26,Name something you do not learn in school.
T002,699.69,700.68,0.99,Kinda tricky.
P148,704.48,706.19,1.71,Like how to do taxes kind of thing.
T002,707.6,710.89,3.29,"Taxes isn't on there, but it should be. I feel like."
P181,710.64,711.2,0.56,Then
T002,711.96,716.17,4.21,I could have used that education. I have to do US taxes every year as well.
P122,713.84,720.42,6.58,"I'm trying to think of the the thing that people always say it's like is it isn't it like car repair, they always wonder."
P181,717.5,718.15,0.65,yeah.
T002,717.67,718.38,0.71,Yeah.
T002,721.23,725.72,4.49,"Uhm, car repair is kind of related to one."

T002,908.58,918.39,9.81,"I though I can't. I mean the question is just something in school, so if you're really in the preschool mindset, you might say looking into those."

P181,998.01,998.96,0.95,Well done.
P175,999.2,999.65,0.45,Yeah.
T002,1005.93,1010.2,4.27,I kind of zoned like if somebody asked like the Group of US who would just said taxes straight away.
P175,1010.54,1011.13,0.59,Yeah.
T002,1013.43,1022.4,8.97,"Yeah, well OK. So we got we got the three of those we had has towards first then we said man it's always said parenting. So what order do you think people would go in?"

P181,1030.36,1031.17,0.81,But I don't know.
P122,1032.11,1041.44,9.33,"Tickets a weird answer to that, like to be asked, like what do you wish you had learned in school of etiquette, so I don't know why you would say that. Even if you were older."
P175,1034.04,1034.48,0.44,Yeah.
T002,1034.81,1035.68,0.87,Yeah.

P122,1045.16,1045.69,0.53,Yeah.
P122,1047.29,1052.79,5.5,Maybe maybe parenting first. Maybe that's quite salient for people and then.
P175,1049.13,1049.88,0.75,Yeah.
T002,1049.79,1050.52,0.73,Yeah.
P175,1051.6,1054.78,3.18,"Yeah, yeah, you know what? You don't learn in school parents."

'cause as he said, it's been so hard to kind of get people and get people to show up to zoom call, so it shouldn't be so difficult. But it is. So you really help with that here. Thank you so much."
P181,1123.87,1124.65,0.78,No worries.
P175,1124.71,1126.58,1.87,"Sure, no problem, thank you."
