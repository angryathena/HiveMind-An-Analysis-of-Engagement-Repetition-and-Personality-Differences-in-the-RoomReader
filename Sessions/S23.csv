T002,0.05,2.39,2.34,"Alright, I think it's recording so we can go ahead."
T002,3.18,18.65,15.47,"So today we're just going to play a quiz game super Easy so you don't need to worry about anything. Don't be stressed, it's it might be familiar to you if you've seen the TV show family feud or a family fight, but if not, don't worry. I'm going to explain it anyway."
T002,19.64,38.45,18.81,"So I'm going to ask you guys a question which was also asked to 100 people in a survey and you have to guess the top three most popular answers to the question. So for example, if I said name something people are afraid of, you might come up with spiders heights and other people."
T002,39.38,48.23,8.85,"Uhm, and then afterwards I'm gonna ask you to rank these 3 answers. So in this case spiders would be first, most popular then heights, and then other people third."
T002,50.54,52.21,1.67,Us like clear enough.
T002,53.37,55.02,1.65,I want to give a question ago you ready.
T002,57.65,60.58,2.93,Cool OK question one.
T002,61.49,64.88,3.39,"Name something or sorry, did you? Another question."
T002,67.61,69.16,1.55,"OK and yeah, just."
P158,68.63,70.12,1.49,Comma question so.
T002,71.13,71.58,0.45,Sorry.
P158,72.34,74.2,1.86,"Well, you know it's fun doing."
T002,74.69,76.59,1.9,"Oh no, sorry I keep talking over you."
T002,77.67,94.95,17.28,"Uhm, but yeah in this scenario as well, just to say you're working together, you're not like competing or anything, so you just shut out whatever things come to your mind and you can argue that which is the most popular or whatever. I'll let you know when you've arrived at the top 3 answers, and then afterwards I'll ask you to order them."
T002,99.12,101.33,2.21,"OK, so question would."
T002,102.4,105.58,3.18,Name something people are often chased by in movies?
P138,108.17,108.66,0.49,Police
P139,108.27,108.72,0.45,Ours.
T002,110.39,111.57,1.18,"Sorry, what do you say Sarah?"
P138,112.39,112.93,0.54,police.
T002,113.33,120.14,6.81,"Police, yeah, that's that's on the list. I said cops, I think it was an American server. Yeah cops police. Same diff. OK, one out of three."
P158,120.41,121.38,0.97,I'm call.
T002,121.97,124.28,2.31,Yeah yeah. Cars cars is number 2.
T002,125.59,127.18,1.59,So we got two out of three.
P126,126.49,126.86,0.37,Birds.
P139,127.83,128.58,0.75,Aliens
T002,129.48,132.02,2.54,Waiter or you said something as well before ideas.
P126,132.81,133.56,0.75,Monsters.
T002,134.0,145.65,11.65,"Yeah, monsters is actually the third one, so aliens, I guess kind of falls into that category. So yeah, OK, that was really quick so we had we had police first, then cars and monsters, so they're the top 3 answers."
P138,134.02,134.35,0.33,I.
T002,146.24,149.53,3.29,So which do you think is most popular? How would you rank these?
P158,151.32,153.69,2.37,I would go car one and then.
P158,154.87,158.36,3.49,Of police two and monsters 3.
T002,161.1,164.11,3.01,"OK, why do you think cars number one out of interest?"
P158,164.22,169.93,5.71,"Uh, I guess if you're being chased by the police or being chased in a car, a lot of the time."
T002,170.69,172.96,2.27,"Yeah, I guess those two kind of intersect."
P158,172.89,174.68,1.79,States of Lincoln then?
P158,175.72,178.91,3.19,"Uh, I don't feel like it's just more common maybe."
P138,179.37,189.6,10.23,"But at the same time, police can be both on foot or in car. So maybe police is a bigger set than the car."
P158,190.27,191.13,0.86,"Yeah, those."
T002,190.73,191.36,0.63,Yeah.
P138,192.61,196.38,3.77,"Because it also includes police by on foot, right?"
T002,196.96,197.44,0.48,Miller
T002,198.83,210.8,11.97,I guess it depends also on genre of movie you watched. Could say you don't really watch a lot of kind of realistic real life based movies. Be watching all the sci-fi or horror film you're going to see more monsters than cops.
T002,212.53,213.42,0.89,So it depends.
P138,215.76,220.34,4.58,Depends who were asked at people who really like movies or something.
T002,218.27,219.06,0.79,Yeah.
T002,220.67,236.37,15.7,"Yeah, it's hard 'cause you're cut. You're not not really facing your answers on logic here. It's just kind of what people said. Well, they're also doesn't have to be necessarily the most like correct answer. OK, so at the moment we've got cars and police and monsters, so they want to switch these around."
P126,238.22,241.11,2.89,I think I would switch cars and cops as well.
T002,241.75,245.84,4.09,"Yes, so cops goes 1st and cars in the middle and then monsters."
P126,246.71,247.47,0.76,"Yeah, maybe."
T002,250.95,251.61,0.66,K.
T002,253.9,255.53,1.63,Everyone good with that or.
P158,255.99,257.4,1.41,"Yeah half of that, yeah."
T002,258.76,259.19,0.43,Yeah.
P138,259.49,261.76,2.27,I'm curious what it is.
T002,262.14,269.21,7.07,"OK, I'll reveal that now I can reveal that the correct answer is actually monsters, cards and then costs."
P126,270.1,270.47,0.37,Oh
T002,270.7,274.97,4.27,"So yeah, maybe big sci-fi watching portion of the population there."
T002,276.28,277.8,1.52,"But yeah, hard to guess."
P158,277.91,280.05,2.14,The monsters first I thought it would be.
P158,281.38,283.52,2.14,I thought you play something else.
T002,281.68,282.37,0.69,Yeah.
T002,284.39,284.92,0.53,Yeah.
T002,285.52,288.19,2.67,I suppose monsters it's a big category like.
P158,288.29,290.17,1.88,"Yeah, it could be anything, yeah."
T002,288.93,290.22,1.29,Hello yeah.
T002,292.53,293.94,1.41,Right well.
T002,294.61,297.88,3.27,"Uh, you guys ready for another question seems to be going well."
T002,300.35,301.04,0.69,OK.
T002,301.76,304.23,2.47,Name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra.
P126,307.2,307.98,0.78,Of violence.

T002,309.15,310.44,1.29,"Yeah, violence on there."
T002,311.59,312.4,0.81,Popular choice.
P158,314.72,316.12,1.4,Flute maybe?
T002,316.61,319.44,2.83,Flute was already is not on there. No flute.
P158,320.35,321.06,0.71,Uhm?
P158,326.61,328.07,1.46,Trumbone something like that.
T002,328.85,330.93,2.08,Now from those on there either.
P158,332.08,333.01,0.93,I'm stuck in here.
T002,333.41,334.88,1.47,"Yeah, it's hard."
P138,334.89,336.07,1.18,Now in the orchestra.
T002,337.44,337.8,0.36,He
P139,337.52,338.37,0.85,Their heart.
T002,339.34,340.49,1.15,hearts not on there.
P138,341.68,343.77,2.09,Very latest choice.
T002,341.7,343.91,2.21,OK so far. What have we got?
T002,345.63,346.16,0.53,Sorry.
P138,347.01,349.35,2.34,Herbs Irish choice of an instrument.
T002,349.35,349.96,0.61,Oh yeah.
P138,351.6,354.21,2.61,"And piano, could it be?"
T002,351.87,352.24,0.37,Yeah.
T002,354.05,358.55,4.5,"No, I would have said the other though, but maybe that's just 'cause I play piano and biased."
T002,359.94,360.49,0.55,So.
P139,360.28,362.43,2.15,Is the director an instrument?
T002,363.97,369.4,5.43,"Though I don't think so well, he's definitely not on the list. I feel like that's a bit of a rogue choice."
T002,370.95,372.75,1.8,So we got violent and there's two more.
P126,373.29,374.32,1.03,A cello maybe?
T002,374.51,379.94,5.43,"Yeah, cello colors on there as well, so violin cello and now we're just missing one."
P158,380.45,380.82,0.37,Uh.
P139,383.16,385.27,2.11,"Drunk, I don't know how it calls."
T002,384.35,384.92,0.57,Yeah.
T002,385.8,391.43,5.63,"Drugs drums is actually on the let's discuss about the last one there. Violin, cello and drums."
T002,392.45,400.92,8.47,Bit of a weird mix. Be funny if it was just all string instruments like violin cello after people get violent and shallow sometimes they start getting a Viola device.
T002,401.59,410.51,8.92,"Just keep running through all the strings. Yeah OK, so we have violin, cello and drums now. Well what do you think's number one in this scenario?"
P158,410.86,411.75,0.89,Violin.
T002,412.52,415.85,3.33,"Yeah, I guess everyone kind of shouted out violence violent makes sense."
P158,414.83,417.07,2.24,Will you please yeah with?
P158,418.39,420.04,1.65,"And then cello, drums."
P138,420.46,422.95,2.49,I I also think so. I I agree.
T002,420.86,421.31,0.45,Fighting.
P158,422.08,422.47,0.39,Awesome.
T002,422.49,422.91,0.42,Yeah.
T002,423.48,426.47,2.99,"I mean, that's the order that you guys arrived at. This stuff makes sense I guess."
T002,427.54,433.73,6.19,"All right, that is the correct order. So well done. Violin, cello, drums."
P158,434.62,435.12,0.5,Oops.
T002,437.96,452.25,14.29,"Sweet, alright, you're on the road. Let's go to the next question I'm going to point out. Actually, before I ask this thought this is asked before the whole coronavirus pandemic situation. So you might want to bear that in mind when you think of your answers."
T002,453.12,458.48,5.36,The question is name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu book.
P158,461.55,464.86,3.31,The tube or the the underground?
T002,465.56,468.23,2.67,That's kind of moving in the right direction.
P158,468.45,468.85,0.4,Yeah.
T002,468.89,471.4,2.51,"Well, it's not. It's not there, though related."
P158,471.63,472.23,0.6,Station.
P138,472.07,473.08,1.01,Public transport
T002,473.39,476.66,3.27,"Public transport it's like a type of public transport, but it's not that cheap."
T002,477.45,478.2,0.75,Not bus.
P158,478.35,480.08,1.73,Louis the.
T002,479.68,480.47,0.79,Not the letters.
P138,482.06,482.69,0.63,train.
P158,483.04,483.49,0.45,Train.
T002,483.82,484.69,0.87,Melt trade.
T002,486.06,487.59,1.53,Louis is a very nice answer.
P158,489.75,490.53,0.78,Uhm?
P158,492.55,494.08,1.53,The way of public transport.
T002,494.57,497.94,3.37,"Yeah, so not any other ones. They said no trains."
P139,501.82,502.39,0.57,Sexy.
T002,503.57,504.56,0.99,Not a taxi.
P138,504.83,506.16,1.33,"Not the boss, right?"
T002,506.38,506.92,0.54,No.
P158,507.86,508.39,0.53,Uh.

P158,512.95,513.48,0.53,"Oh, really."
P138,517.15,518.37,1.22,Maybe work?
T002,519.64,524.17,4.53,Work isn't on the list. I feel like that's a very coronavirus themed answer.
T002,525.93,527.22,1.29,Really working from home.
P139,526.13,528.14,2.01,Escuela maybe?
T002,528.67,534.4,5.73,"School, yeah, that's on the list is OK. Two out of three, so it's cool. We got airplanes in school. It's a little boy."
P139,529.42,530.28,0.86,With children.
T002,536.81,546.87,10.06,School ready is not half bad infection. I've got like 4 primary schools near my house so just watching all the kids just kind of rubs not on each other all day makes me nervous.
P138,548.86,550.71,1.85,I don't know what's the third one.
P139,551.8,552.71,0.91,In the church.

P158,560.34,561.81,1.47,Or maybe the doctors?
T002,562.67,576.14,13.47,"Oh yeah, Doctor is trying to think of a bigger kind of building that has doctors in it hospital. Yeah OK all right we've got the three airplanes he said first that schools and hospitals all right."
P139,566.42,567.17,0.75,Hospital
P158,568.62,568.91,0.29,Yeah.
T002,577.15,579.4,2.25,"No, what do you think you drank these?"
P139,580.87,582.52,1.65,I would put school 1st.
T002,583.77,589.8,6.03,"Yeah, I guess everyone kind of has been in school and know someone in school as a child in school makes sense."
P158,591.82,593.31,1.49,UN hospital next.
P138,593.75,594.45,0.7,Jeremy Turner
P158,595.26,597.02,1.76,And then airplane third.

T002,605.07,607.78,2.71,"That is the correct order, well, good."
T002,609.52,620.78,11.26,"Airplane stuff via weird one. I would never think of an airplane like when someone says public transport. I'd just be like Oh yeah, the bus, but maybe that's 'cause I'm in a very local mindset. Code with brain telling me I can't go anywhere."
T002,622.0,622.77,0.77,Uhm?
T002,624.19,626.22,2.03,Right when I go to the next question?
T002,626.99,628.83,1.84,Which is kind of a bit of a tough one.
T002,630.01,632.32,2.31,Name something you do not learn in school.
P158,638.42,640.65,2.23,Tuck Tuck says also.
T002,641.27,646.86,5.59,"Mel taxes, that's all under which is so weird. So I feel like a destiny wasn't someone our age. He was asked."
P138,647.73,648.38,0.65,Cooking.
P158,647.83,648.32,0.49,Blood.
T002,649.28,651.81,2.53,Cooking is related to one of them.
P158,652.38,653.08,0.7,Cleaning.
T002,653.94,660.67,6.73,"OK, cooking and cleaning. Watch those both kind of full yeah. Housekeeping like his chores, that's that's one of them."
P138,656.13,656.88,0.75,Housekeeping.
T002,661.24,663.46,2.22,So one out of three has tours.
T002,673.93,675.53,1.6,Something you don't learn in school.
P138,679.69,680.56,0.87,Earning money.
P158,680.95,691.04,10.09,"I would say there's a lot of it, like history that you don't learn."
T002,682.59,686.57,3.98,"Nonetheless, they wish it was still be handy."
P139,687.96,688.33,0.37,R.
P158,692.36,697.15,4.79,"If not, you will see from the side of from a biased perspective."
T002,692.52,693.31,0.79,Oh yeah.
T002,697.8,703.73,5.93,"Oh yeah, interesting. You say that as an English person, I remember talking to so many people he didn't learn anything about like."
P158,703.87,706.92,3.05,Literally nothing about Ireland and England.
T002,704.29,704.64,0.35,I.
T002,705.6,711.9,6.3,"Yeah, uh, that's not on the list, but you know good good shout, good point."
T002,719.96,726.77,6.81,"OK, so try to think of something. Maybe that your parents would have said to you when you were a kid. Like oh, you wouldn't learn that the school doesn't know."
P158,727.23,727.78,0.55,Manners.
T002,728.12,732.8,4.68,"Manners, yeah, that's that's another one. So we got two out of three. Now there's one left."
P138,737.03,738.16,1.13,Revival skills
T002,738.89,741.51,2.62,"No, uh, I'll be from there."
P138,743.38,745.24,1.86,unless it's a tough Russian school.
T002,745.73,752.54,6.81,"Oh yeah, I feel like I kind of had a bit of automatic survival skills taught to me, just like going to a shared school in primary school."
T002,759.3,765.7,6.4,"OK, I try to think of responsibilities you might have that you don't learn about that you're not told about."
P158,765.3,767.87,2.57,Like how to how to raise a kid or something.
T002,768.19,775.22,7.03,"Yeah, parenting, that's the that's the third one. OK, so we had house chores, manners, and parenting."
T002,776.16,778.06,1.9,"Yeah, you see that I mean about kind of."
T002,778.65,781.66,3.01,I it's I feel like it's kind of a generational question.
T002,782.33,785.2,2.87,"Like it really depends what stage of life you're at, what you say?"
T002,786.24,787.07,0.83,This question.
P126,787.5,792.35,4.85,"It also depends on in which country the people live in. I think the school systems are very different, different countries."
T002,792.48,797.51,5.03,"Oh yeah, definitely. I mean even the choice when they clearly never did home economics."
P126,798.35,798.69,0.34,Yeah.
T002,801.43,807.38,5.95,"OK, So what? What do you think you put first under these trees? So has choice, manners and parenting."
T002,809.66,811.25,1.59,There's something you don't mind in school.
P158,811.36,812.15,0.79,Parenting.

P139,830.21,838.54,8.33,"Because manners, maybe they a little bit. If you do a bit your friend maybe they put you in punishment now."
T002,842.64,843.39,0.75,OK.
T002,844.59,847.98,3.39,So parenting and add chores and then monies.
T002,849.8,852.06,2.26,Everyone good with that or you want to switch it around at all?
P158,853.82,854.77,0.95,That's good to go.
T002,855.31,862.1,6.79,"OK, well actually it was parenting first, so that's right. But then manners and then high stories last."
P126,863.16,863.59,0.43,OK.
P138,864.18,866.26,2.08,Restricted parents answering the question.
T002,866.68,872.33,5.65,"Yeah God, I definitely feel like it was that kind of age group like."
T002,873.02,879.98,6.96,"Parents, they're all kind of in a common theme, aren't they? Like manners, chores, parenting, or kind of related?"
T002,884.54,889.87,5.33,"All right, uh? We're going to do one more question. And then you guys are free to go."
T002,891.33,893.1,1.77,A bit of a weird one as well.
T002,894.03,895.86,1.83,Name something people cut.

T002,905.14,912.81,7.67,"Yeah, hairs on their vegetables isn't on there, but it's related like so, not vegetables, but another type of food. So we got her. We got one of the three."

P138,927.74,929.41,1.67,Nails fingernails.
T002,929.94,930.88,0.94,Not nails.
T002,931.74,937.69,5.95,"So there is. There's like a food type in there, so if it's not vegetables and it's not fruit."
P158,941.73,942.2,0.47,Bread.
T002,943.17,944.03,0.86,No fridge.
T002,944.83,946.44,1.61,It's like the opposite of vegetables.
T002,949.21,953.7,4.49,"Oliver, I think hearing muted or yeah meet."
P139,950.78,951.35,0.57,Meet.
T002,954.59,961.04,6.45,"But again, the very weird. I definitely wouldn't say that that's off the top of my head. If someone else like what do people usually cut?"
T002,961.71,963.42,1.71,"The road down, Sir, but it is on there."
P138,962.05,963.18,1.13,Do you hear me?
T002,964.02,965.7,1.68,So we've got hair and meat.
T002,966.36,967.41,1.05,And then there's one more.
P139,970.37,972.92,2.55,Please let me say I don't know.
T002,974.37,975.11,0.74,What did you say?
P139,975.52,976.09,0.57,Trees.
T002,976.52,977.62,1.1,Trisno
P139,977.73,978.0,0.27,No.
T002,989.66,993.34,3.68,"yeah, it's kind of there's one that's kind of related to trees, I suppose."
P138,994.71,995.58,0.87,Not the grass.
T002,996.1,997.44,1.34,"No, not the grass."
T002,998.92,1001.76,2.84,Kind of a tree related tree based products.
P139,1002.22,1002.79,0.57,Good.
T002,1003.64,1004.4,0.76,Not words.
P138,1004.07,1004.63,0.56,Lamps.
P139,1004.71,1005.0,0.29,Oh
P138,1006.51,1007.11,0.6,Flowers
T002,1007.75,1008.3,0.55,No.
T002,1009.6,1011.21,1.61,Wattpad a.
T002,1013.02,1020.81,7.79,"Something that you'd say you were trying to think of a if you're an artist, what would you cut a lot of maybe?"
P138,1021.36,1021.87,0.51,paper.
T002,1022.28,1024.18,1.9,"Yeah, paper, that's the third one."
T002,1025.61,1030.78,5.17,"But I guess an artist maybe doesn't cut paper. I couldn't think maybe a gift wrapper started, you know I."
P138,1029.15,1030.95,1.8,I would say here.
T002,1031.95,1035.0,3.05,"Yeah, her first seems to make sense."
T002,1035.74,1039.19,3.45,"So we've got. We've got her, we felt meat and we got paper."
T002,1040.92,1042.59,1.67,So it pairs number one.
P138,1044.56,1045.89,1.33,Maybe baby per second.
T002,1046.51,1052.04,5.53,"Yeah, her first paper, second unmeet third where it belongs."
T002,1056.37,1058.02,1.65,And that is the right order.
P139,1060.71,1063.76,3.05,I I thought meat would go more higher.
T002,1064.67,1075.02,10.35,"Maybe it's like, yeah, maybe it's a different. It depends like I know what country you're from and what your family eat a lot of. But I definitely I definitely think needs such a rogue choice."
P138,1075.44,1080.56,5.12,But I would also use a different verb. For me. It's like chop the meat or not only cut it.
P158,1075.59,1075.83,0.24,Yeah.
T002,1081.24,1089.17,7.93,"Yeah, yeah, I suppose maybe maybe that's where it came from. Maybe people feel like you chopped rather than cut vegetables and you cut meat."
T002,1090.48,1090.95,0.47,I don't know.
T002,1095.27,1096.38,1.11,Right well.
T002,1098.07,1106.26,8.19,"I think we're. I think we're kind of done, so clean room reader is gonna come back and Randolph this session and tell you a few more things that you need to do to finish up."
T002,1107.17,1109.56,2.39,"Uh, or maybe just one more thing, actually."
