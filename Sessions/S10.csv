T001,1.44,9.85,8.41,OK so hi everyone and thanks for coming. Today we're going to be playing quiz so I'm going to ask you a question that we asked 100 people.
T001,10.52,27.65,17.13,"And you need to give me the three most popular answers to that question. And then I'm going to ask you to rank them from the most popular to the least popular. So, for example, if the question was named something that people are afraid of, you would say perhaps. Heights, spiders, and other people."
T001,28.36,32.31,3.95,"And the ranking would be spiders heights, other people."
T001,33.58,35.02,1.44,So any questions on that?
T001,36.86,43.31,6.45,"No, OK, so our first question is name something that people are often chased by in movies."
T001,47.12,48.29,1.17,"Car this is one of them, yeah."
P057,52.76,53.61,0.85,Other people.
P063,55.43,56.84,1.41,Name something that.
T001,56.4,60.47,4.07,Silly people are often chased by in movies.

P057,78.28,79.31,1.03,I said villains.
T001,80.61,81.38,0.77,In a way.
T001,84.16,86.95,2.79,"Sometimes the last one is villains, but."
T001,90.92,94.79,3.87,Are there any particular types of movies out there where people get chased?
P047,94.36,96.73,2.37,Uhm like monsters.
T001,96.99,111.9,14.91,Monsters yeah monsters yeah. And so I think we had cars first cops 2nd and monsters 3rd. So I'm going to ask you to rank them now from the most popular to least popular and we have to reach a consensus on this.
T001,116.3,117.73,1.43,Does anyone got any thoughts?
P057,119.63,130.56,10.93,"Well, if you want to base it on the current movies that are being released at the moment, monsters we first and then you probably have an."
P057,131.63,134.31,2.68,Either cops or cars like.
P057,134.98,137.11,2.13,Somewhere you know interchanging there.

T001,143.36,148.44,5.08,"I was just gonna say, it seems that we had a good bit of agreement that monsters would be first so."
P068,149.2,156.63,7.43,"I was just going to say, yeah, I agree that monster should be first and according to me I think cops then cars would be something that I would think."
P047,157.64,158.25,0.61,I agree.
P063,157.72,159.19,1.47,"Yes, I agree, yeah."
P057,159.58,160.29,0.71,Likewise.
T001,160.79,163.36,2.57,"OK, so we're going monsters."
T001,164.75,166.6,1.85,And then cops. Was it in cars?
P068,165.94,166.27,0.33,Yeah.
P047,167.48,167.88,0.4,Yes.
T001,168.61,175.04,6.43,"So monsters is first, but cars and cops are swapped around, so it's cars 2nd and cops turd."
T001,176.03,181.07,5.04,"So unfortunately didn't get that one, but we've got another few questions, so hopefully you can get the next one."
T001,181.81,185.64,3.83,Our next question is name an instrument in a Symphony Orchestra.

T001,238.37,242.79,4.42,"I don't think the conductor counts as an instrument, but it's not there anyway, so it's not there anymore."
P047,240.31,240.76,0.45,No.
P047,242.25,243.71,1.46,"Right, OK, right?"

T001,260.07,263.26,3.19,"So what do you think was the most popular dental, at least popular with that?"
P063,264.68,266.79,2.11,I think violin is the most popular.

T001,280.14,294.15,14.01,"Well, I'm I'm glad to say that's correct. Yeah, that's that's one correct order. So we're one out of two for the moment. Let's see if we can get the third one. So name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or flu."
P047,282.87,283.16,0.29,Yeah.
T001,294.83,301.04,6.21,"With the knows that this was given to people before the pandemic, so the answer isn't everywhere but."
T001,302.98,306.08,3.1,Sort of tree places where you would likely catch a cold or flu.
P057,306.17,307.32,1.15,A hospital.
T001,307.84,309.32,1.48,"Yep, Hospital is one of them."

T001,343.03,346.985,3.955,"Very very good again these quickly, but now we've got to do the hard part which is ranking them."
P047,350.36,354.61,4.25,"I would I personally would put school first, I would say."
P057,357.24,374.41,17.17,"I yeah, I agree. I reckon Eric in the hospital just 'cause they are immunocompromised people there. So it means they need system is lower so it's more likely for them to get ill. And then maybe school and then airplanes because airplanes are somewhat sanitized."
P068,357.41,358.34,0.93,Ask first.
P063,358.06,359.01,0.95,Hospital
P063,361.68,362.17,0.49,yeah.

T001,384.47,387.78,3.31,"We're going hospital, school, airplane."
T001,390.8,403.92,13.12,"Well, school and hospital were actually switched around. Airplane is the last one, but it goes school, hospital, airplane. So you were close, you're close. I think it's a bit of a 5050 between school and hospital to be honest."
P047,391.01,391.34,0.33,Yes.
P057,397.29,397.96,0.67,Ah.

T001,668.59,673.52,4.93,"Might be something that you know you need now, but might be a skill potentially in the future."
T001,684.59,689.15,4.56,So it's something that you don't learn about that you might need later on in life possibly.
T001,701.44,704.29,2.85,You know you might wish that you were taught this when it actually does happen.

P057,785.11,786.17,1.06,As in what?
T001,786.89,790.03,3.14,What would be the most popular yeah?
P057,788.06,789.49,1.43,Most popular.
T001,791.62,794.37,2.75,Of those going down to the least popular.

P063,811.8,812.22,0.42,Yeah.
P057,812.7,813.55,0.85,And then.
P047,816.16,818.81,2.65,I said choice being the middle one I think.
P057,821.56,823.75,2.19,Yeah 'cause I yeah.
P068,821.66,822.31,0.65,Reflex.
P068,825.46,830.85,5.39,"I feel like maybe you could push parenting a bit higher. According to me, I don't know what what. Does anybody else think?"
T001,833.27,834.9,1.63,I suppose it depends on how old you are.
P057,837.06,846.11,9.05,"Yeah, and like where you're from because I remember from school that I I learned manners and household chores. But parenting never."
P057,846.83,847.31,0.48,So.
T001,849.35,850.54,1.19,"Lillian, what he think?"
P063,853.14,854.41,1.27,Me Lillian.
T001,854.77,855.11,0.34,Yep.
P063,855.51,859.9,4.39,"Ah yes, probably yes. Parenting is important. Even if we didn't find it."
P063,861.32,862.63,1.31,So maybe not last.
P063,866.18,868.83,2.65,But that's cool. We didn't learn about charge.
P063,870.25,870.76,0.51,Mask.
P063,872.84,874.83,1.99,Minors to some degree years.
P057,876.82,885.36,8.54,I feel like he could put in madness first because I think talking to each other you learn some like manners in a way. And then maybe.
P063,884.4,884.88,0.48,Yeah.
P057,885.94,890.26,4.32,I don't know. There are some schools that have the pairing thing kind of side of things.
P057,891.79,893.72,1.93,"As a quote as well, I don't know."
P057,894.57,895.12,0.55,You know?
P063,898.49,901.64,3.15,Probably manners and parenting condensers.
P057,902.56,906.49,3.93,"OK, well I agree with that. Yeah yeah yeah."
P063,903.27,905.35,2.08,"Yeah yeah, yeah."
P047,904.72,906.26,1.54,"Yeah yeah, let's go with that."
P063,906.57,907.18,0.61,Seems right.
T001,907.45,911.24,3.79,"So are we all in agreement that it's manners, parenting and then chores?"
P047,911.87,912.27,0.4,Yes.
T001,913.81,918.31,4.5,"Well, unfortunately it's it's parenting first matters and then chores. And I."
P047,918.32,919.11,0.79,I Wan.
T001,919.16,924.83,5.67,"I suppose it depends on the age group of people asked. Some of them might have been parents and going, oh, I wish I knew that, but."
T001,926.16,927.27,1.11,Unfortunately not it.
T001,927.86,931.91,4.05,"We do have chores last though, so that's something we've got. One more question though."
T001,932.71,936.63,3.92,And hopefully you can get this from then. It's you know two for five.
T001,938.0,940.13,2.13,Name something that people cut.
T001,942.21,943.59,1.38,It's a bit of a vague question.
T001,944.46,946.15,1.69,What are some things that people cut?
P068,946.92,947.72,0.8,Vegetables.
P063,947.51,948.25,0.74,Paper.
T001,949.07,952.54,3.47,Paper is one of them. Vegetables is close to 1.
P063,953.62,954.81,1.19,Got their hands.
P057,953.68,954.52,0.84,Produce.
T001,955.56,957.86,2.3,"Not their hand, no other did you say something?"
P057,958.46,961.32,2.86,Does it produce like like fruits or veg?
T001,961.49,963.23,1.74,Close still getting close.
P057,961.96,962.84,0.88,We either.
P047,969.48,970.57,1.09,And treats.
T001,971.44,974.21,2.77,"Not trees, it's another good one, but it's not on the list."
P047,974.58,975.49,0.91,Oh grass.
T001,976.22,978.25,2.03,"Another good one, but also not on the list."
T001,979.46,981.76,2.3,"All very good, but unfortunately not the top tree."
T001,982.99,984.26,1.27,"Amelia, have you got any?"
P068,986.78,987.22,0.44,No.
T001,988.09,992.58,4.49,"So we've got papers one, and we're pretty close with vegetables or projects, but we're not."
T001,993.15,994.16,1.01,Not actually on it.
P047,995.57,995.86,0.29,At.
T001,996.71,999.8,3.09,"Bread, but keep focusing around food."
P068,999.89,1000.36,0.47,Meet.
T001,1000.66,1001.77,1.11,Miss Yep.
T001,1003.03,1004.4,1.37,She got paper and meat.
T001,1007.39,1008.48,1.09,But it's something else.
T001,1009.53,1011.84,2.31,That you would cuss and you know.
T001,1012.76,1016.27,3.51,Maybe not something that you haven't gotten cut for awhile in these times.
P057,1016.73,1017.3,0.57,Hey.
T001,1017.69,1018.26,0.57,Pair.
T001,1019.22,1019.87,0.65,Yep.
T001,1021.51,1025.58,4.07,Haircuts I should probably say that this one was also done pre pandemic but.
P057,1023.78,1024.06,0.28,Hey.
P063,1026.73,1027.18,0.45,Yeah.
T001,1029.51,1031.86,2.35,So we're going to ask you to rank them once again.
P063,1037.39,1039.45,2.06,Share probably the most.
T001,1040.28,1044.42,4.14,"Here, probably the most certainly before before all this happened."
P063,1043.92,1046.95,3.03,"OK, yeah, you mean how often we do it."
T001,1047.42,1052.87,5.45,"Well, but if I say to you name something that people cut, what would be the most popular?"
P057,1054.98,1055.39,0.41,Hey.
P047,1056.05,1057.7,1.65,"Yeah, I would agree here, yeah."
P063,1057.07,1058.3,1.23,"Yeah, yeah."
T001,1059.12,1060.3,1.18,You're going to her first.
P047,1060.71,1061.12,0.41,Miller
T001,1061.35,1064.77,3.42,"And what about me? Some paper, what are we gonna do with that?"
P063,1069.4,1071.42,2.02,Meet and then play.
P057,1071.06,1071.99,0.93,Then paper.
P047,1072.9,1074.05,1.15,"yeah, I agree."
P057,1074.41,1080.9,6.49,"'cause you eat the meat so you cut the meat to eat it, whereas paper you can kind of just tear it."
P057,1081.95,1082.54,0.59,And just.
P057,1083.63,1085.66,2.03,"Yeah, well, scratch away."
T001,1083.91,1084.97,1.06,"Amelia, what do you think of that?"
P068,1086.09,1090.72,4.63,And I was kind of more inclined to paper and then me.
P068,1092.1,1097.52,5.42,"But yeah, I do guess what Ileana is trying to say. Yeah I like yeah."
T001,1098.99,1103.62,4.63,So are we all happy with the ranking there? Her first beat 2nd and paper turd?
P047,1104.9,1105.27,0.37,Yes.
T001,1106.58,1106.93,0.35,OK.
T001,1108.34,1110.29,1.95,I'm sorry to say again that it's.
T001,1111.54,1119.64,8.1,"Yeah, her hair is number one, but that's the policy of those. But unfortunately paper and be sure the other way was Amelia was was right on this one."
P047,1114.38,1115.35,0.97,You
T001,1121.38,1128.58,7.2,"Plus, thanks for playing guys, you got one out of five, and that's not a bad score. Love you sure? Yeah, not that it matters, but."
T001,1129.3,1129.95,0.65,Thanks for playing.
P047,1131.68,1132.35,0.67,thank you.
