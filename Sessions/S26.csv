T001,2.77,14.14,11.37,"OK so hi everyone, thanks for coming today. We're going to play a quiz so I am going to ask you a question that was asked 100 people and you need to give me the tree most popular answers to that question."
T001,14.92,20.31,5.39,"After you get the tree, most popular answers as a team, you're going to rank them from the most popular."
T001,20.89,30.7,9.81,"To the least popular and we need to get a bit of consensus on that. So there's loads of fun for arguments there. So for example, if I said name, something that people are afraid of."
P174,30.76,31.15,0.39,And.
T001,32.22,33.33,1.11,"Oh, I've got a question."
T001,35.84,39.73,3.89,A month and if I said name something that people are afraid of.
T001,40.34,43.79,3.45,"You could say heights, older people, spiders."
P174,44.23,44.67,0.44,Device.
T001,44.87,50.44,5.57,"And then the ordering would be spiders heights, other people. So any questions on this?"
P174,47.26,47.63,0.37,Next
P174,52.38,52.87,0.49,I never do.
T001,52.78,59.51,6.73,"Nope, brilliant. So our first question is going to be named something that people are often chased by in movies."
P174,63.64,64.3,0.66,Police
P170,64.8,65.55,0.75,Other people.
T001,66.23,70.93,4.7,"Police is yeah, police is one of them. Older people is a bit vague, but."
P164,66.37,67.49,1.12,"After people, yeah."
P170,69.71,70.06,0.35,Sir.
P164,71.45,73.21,1.76,"Yeah, yeah."
T001,72.5,73.46,0.96,Police is one of them.
P170,73.13,73.85,0.72,Dogs.
T001,75.06,76.25,1.19,"No, dogs isn't there."
P076,79.62,80.32,0.7,Pounds.
T001,81.52,84.54,3.02,"Plans aren't there either, but you know might be related to one of them."
P170,85.39,85.86,0.47,Cars.
P170,86.69,87.3,0.61,Vehicles.
T001,87.75,89.4,1.65,"Yeah, cars cars is another one."
P174,90.67,91.42,0.75,Tacky
P164,91.23,92.86,1.63,Of monsters.
P164,93.47,94.31,0.84,Is that too vague?
T001,93.5,102.45,8.95,"And monsters is yeah, no. Monsters is a the last one that we were looking for. So in the order you gave it to me, I think it's cops cars and then monsters."
P170,97.85,98.26,0.41,OK.
P164,99.07,99.46,0.39,Cool.
T001,104.12,108.81,4.69,So what would be the ranking from most popular answer to the least popular answer of those?
P164,106.26,106.67,0.41,Yeah.
T001,110.1,111.83,1.73,"You need to decide as a group, so."
P170,112.99,113.52,0.53,OK.
P164,113.35,115.68,2.33,When you when you say popular do you mean?
P164,117.57,121.07,3.5,The ones which we think happened the most or just are.
T001,120.46,124.76,4.3,So out of the out of the 100 people asked what were the most popular answers?
P164,122.34,122.89,0.55,Section.
P164,125.5,126.45,0.95,"Right, OK?"
P170,128.16,130.68,2.52,"OK, how about we take turns?"
P170,131.58,132.4,0.82,And see.
P164,132.47,132.9,0.43,Yeah.
P076,133.0,134.26,1.26,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
T001,133.83,138.22,4.39,And you guys decide how you want to go about this. You just need to give me an answer as a team at the end.
P170,136.71,137.18,0.47,OK.
P076,138.83,143.31,4.48,Would we say monsters mainly to do with horror films? Is that what we're thinking or?
P170,143.35,145.03,1.68,And cops with crime.
P076,145.34,145.99,0.65,Yeah.
P164,147.67,153.09,5.42,I would say cops was the most popular answer. Just because when you think of.
P164,154.56,158.15,3.59,"You know, well, I think there's two reasons. One is when you think of people being chased."
P164,158.83,164.22,5.39,"The first thing you think is police chase, but also I think there's probably more."
P164,165.71,171.18,5.47,Movies where people are chasing people are chased by the cops and drive movies where people are chased by the monsters.
P164,172.02,174.39,2.37,But that is maybe not true.
P170,174.89,187.52,12.63,"I'd say the most popular should be cars, because regardless of the movie type or the Jonah ah, you know he could be chased by a car, even if it's a horror or if it's a crime."
P164,183.61,184.32,0.71,Let's go fight.
P164,187.35,188.7,1.35,"Yeah, yeah, that's a good point."
P174,189.38,190.05,0.67,You're going to jail.
P170,189.72,190.74,1.02,So many cars.
P164,190.21,190.65,0.44,Yeah.
P174,192.36,198.16,5.8,I say monsters is lost 'cause we were the last to know is that when we found so it's probably the last one. Other people tend to.
P164,192.95,194.04,1.09,"Yeah, it's your whole leg."
P164,199.06,200.27,1.21,"Yeah, it's a good point."
P170,199.11,199.71,0.6,Possibly.
P164,201.5,202.1,0.6,I think.
P170,202.86,203.63,0.77,Maybe?
P164,202.98,204.45,1.47,The the thinking of.
P164,206.07,207.6,1.53,Did sorry thinking of.
P164,208.25,213.38,5.13,You know cars are in all movies months or throwing in monster movies and police are only in.
P164,214.06,215.23,1.17,Action movies are.
P170,214.16,214.79,0.63,Crime.
P164,216.52,217.49,0.97,"Like I think, just bite."
P164,218.67,221.58,2.91,That's that's a very logical approach is both carriers so.
P170,218.85,219.51,0.66,So.
P170,222.17,229.07,6.9,So would you guys say that it would be right to put it in a cars then?
P170,229.78,231.16,1.38,Monsters are police.
P170,234.41,235.28,0.87,Is everyone?
P164,235.54,236.09,0.55,So.
P170,237.47,239.02,1.55,Like on the same page with that.
P174,237.85,238.25,0.4,Yeah.
P164,238.18,239.31,1.13,I'd say police said then.
P076,239.98,242.01,2.03,"Yeah, maybe police and then monsters."
P174,242.54,242.91,0.37,And.
P164,242.6,243.17,0.57,Yeah.
P170,242.66,243.97,1.31,Police and then monsters.
P170,244.61,246.42,1.81,"So cars, police, monsters."
P164,245.18,245.72,0.54,Yeah.
T001,247.68,250.32,2.64,"Have a bit of agreement on cars, police, monsters."
P164,247.68,248.31,0.63,Yeah.
P174,251.19,251.56,0.37,Yep.
P164,251.43,254.02,2.59,"Yeah, I think it's good."
P170,251.62,251.97,0.35,Yeah.
P170,252.95,253.91,0.96,We're in agreement.
T001,254.0,257.75,3.75,"So the order is actually monsters, cars and then police."
P076,258.31,258.96,0.65,OK.
P164,258.47,259.15,0.68,Hot damn it.
P076,259.88,260.15,0.27,Yeah.
T001,260.11,266.24,6.13,"So someone for that one I'm afraid. But you know, we've got. We've got a couple more questions, so maybe you can make up for it."
P174,260.25,260.92,0.67,Perfect.

T001,327.89,333.72,5.83,"The drums is the last one that we're looking for, so those are the tree you gave me violin, cello and then drums."
T001,334.3,335.01,0.71,What's the ordering?
P076,337.59,344.14,6.55,"Well, I would say violin first, 'cause often violins are kind of one of the main pieces in an orchestra."
P164,340.27,340.79,0.52,Yeah.
P164,345.06,349.05,3.99,"They set the front as well. It's the one everyone would know, yeah?"
P076,347.14,350.19,3.05,"Yeah, yeah, like you have your first fight and he's like that's cool."

P076,351.23,353.58,2.35,"And often they'll have like a little solo as well, so."
P164,354.08,355.1,1.02,"Yeah yeah, yeah."
P164,357.49,359.92,2.43,I think the actual order is pretty good.
P076,357.56,358.07,0.51,Channel
P174,360.59,361.4,0.81,"Yeah, I think so too."
P164,361.79,373.48,11.69,"Like I mean you when you feel sure you just don't go. You don't go drums first or second really like you you do. What we did have picked out everything from the string section, everything from the horrors."
P076,361.95,364.19,2.24,yeah I was. Yeah she comes last.
P076,367.55,367.96,0.41,Yeah.
P076,374.16,375.06,0.9,"Very true, yeah."
P164,374.87,375.6,0.73,Then go back.
P164,376.4,377.19,0.79,Go back to like.
P164,378.53,379.38,0.85,Work your way back.
P170,378.84,382.77,3.93,I think drums might be second on the list because drums are.
P170,383.39,387.32,3.93,State everywhere. I think we just sort of forgot about them.
P076,388.52,392.11,3.59,I think it was it a Symphony Orchestra or.
P164,388.83,389.19,0.36,Well.
T001,391.79,393.46,1.67,It was a Symphony Orchestra yet.
P076,393.46,395.47,2.01,I feel like when you think of a simple orchestra.
P170,394.29,396.04,1.75,"OK, maybe then not."
P076,396.42,409.03,12.61,"Yeah I did. I get what you mean though. Like drums. Definitely like if you think they're like a very common instrument in every type of music, but maybe in this sense and asking if you think but it's like the backbeat is the drum sometimes so I don't know."
P170,398.36,398.93,0.57,Yeah.
P164,407.76,408.25,0.49,Yeah.
P170,408.51,409.0,0.49,Here.
T001,410.98,418.5,7.52,"So there seems to be a bit of a consensus between tree. I think, at least in the order that you gave it to me, so it will be violin, cello, and drum."
P170,419.12,419.61,0.49,Yeah.
P164,419.72,420.47,0.75,I would agree with that.
P170,420.97,422.13,1.16,I agree with that as well.
T001,422.05,427.48,5.43,"Everyone seems to be nodding, and that's a good thing. 'cause that is the order. The order is violin, cello, and drum."
P174,422.89,423.36,0.47,So do I.
P170,428.31,428.84,0.53,Oof.
